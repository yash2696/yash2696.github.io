This book starts with Mohini and goes on to tell the stories of all the mainstream avatars of Vishnu and what the significance of those avatars was, in their respective time periods.</description>

It was an exciting read for me. I must say the amount of research done by the author is really commendable. Given the topic of this work, the author comes very close to getting everything right, but eventually, he misses the mark.</description>
