Hi there,<br>
I am Yash Agarwal(यश अग्रवाल, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4" target="_blank">y-uh-sh</a>). I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Calicut, India. I love trying new operating systems, new tech, and new programming languages. Well, pretty much everything remotely related to the tech.

People say that I don't smile much. That's somewhat true. I am not a camera friendly person. I have very few photos where I am smiling. So I chose that picture to display here.

In my "spare time", I like walking alone, in random thoughts and reading Quora. I don't have many friends cause I believe that I am very bad in judging people (for me, Prevention is better than Cure).

My current operating system is Arch Linux on with Budgie Desktop and some custom scripts to manage various aspects that Budgie Desktop doesn't offer yet, e.g. a lock screen.

Recently I started using [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63354397-yash-agarwal) also as I am trying to get started with the amazing world of books. Hope I will be able to get good results by this.
