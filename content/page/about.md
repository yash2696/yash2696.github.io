Hi there,<br>
I am Yash Agarwal. I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Calicut, India. I love trying new operating systems, new tech and new programming languages. Well, pretty much everything remotely related to the tech.

Recently I started using [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63354397-yash-agarwal) also as I am trying to get started with the amazing world of books. Hope I will be able to get good results by this.


My only motivation to create this blog is to document what I do in day to day life and to help people with my knowledge.
