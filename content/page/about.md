Hi there,<br>
I am Yash Agarwal(यश अग्रवाल, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4" target="_blank">y-uh-sh</a>). I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Calicut, India. I love trying new operating systems, new tech, and new programming languages. Well, pretty much everything remotely related to the tech.

People say that I don't smile much. That's somewhat true. I am not a camera friendly person. I have very few photos where I am smiling. So I chose that picture to display here. -->

In my "spare time", I like walking alone, in random thoughts and reading Quora. I don't have many friends cause I believe that I am very bad in judging people (for me, Prevention is better than Cure).

My current operating system is Arch Linux with Gnome Desktop.
