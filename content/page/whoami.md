Hi there, I am Yash ([y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4)) ðŸ‘‹.

I am a computer programmer interested in network security, cryptography, and distributed systems.

I love trying new operating systems, learning new programming languages and ricing my Linux Desktop.

Other than computers, I am interested in economics, books, writing, history and philosophy. Although I do not prefer
discussing my thoughts in public spaces, one to one is always an option.

I work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore.

Most preferred way to contact me is to email at <br/> **yashagarwaljpr+blog [at] gmail [dot] com.**

As an alternative, ping me on [@yash__here](https://twitter.com/yash__here), but the chances that I will see your
message are less
because I do not use Twitter actively.

My resume is [here](/pdf/resume.pdf), but I am not looking for a new job right now.
