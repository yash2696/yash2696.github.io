Hi there, I am Yash ([y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4)) ðŸ‘‹.

I am a computer programmer interested in network security, cryptography, and distributed systems.

I work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore.

I am interested in tech, economics, books, writing, history and philosophy. 

As an introvert, I do not like to talk
a lot in public spaces, but one to one is always an option. Contact me for anything and I will be more than happy to help.

Most preferred way to contact me is to email at <br/> **yashagarwaljpr+blog [at] gmail [dot] com.**

As an alternative, ping me on [@yash__here](https://twitter.com/yash__here).

My resume is [here](/pdf/resume.pdf), but I am not looking for a new job right now.
