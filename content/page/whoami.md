> None of my writings started out as a book project.
I wrote my first book – Seeking Wisdom – as a memorandum for myself with the expectation that I could transfer some of its essentials to my children.
I learn and write because I want to be a little wiser day by day.
I don’t want to be a great-problem-solver. I want to avoid problems – prevent them from happening and doing right from the beginning.
And I focus on consequential decisions.
To paraphrase Buffett and Munger – decision-making is not about making brilliant decisions, but avoiding terrible ones. Mistakes and dumb decisions are a fact of life and I’m going to make more, but as long as I can avoid the big or “fatal” ones I’m fine.

Hi there,<br>
I am Yash Agarwal(यश अग्रवाल, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4" target="_blank">y-uh-sh</a>). A final year undergrad at Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Calicut, India. I love trying new operating systems, new tech, and new programming languages. Well, pretty much everything remotely related to the tech.


I used to be a super studious guy till my 10<sup>th</sup> standard, so I followed the _herd_ and started preparing for IIT JEE. Those two years during coaching taught me a lot of life lessons, which came handy later in my life. Anyhow, two years of slogging and hard work landed me in NIT Calicut, a decision I'll never regret. For someone who never wrote a single line of code before coming to college, to a person who can code in anyone language you throw, NIT Calicut has given me a lot.

Now, I am a changed guy. There's much more to me rather than just studying. I tend to invest my time watching movies, reading blogs, hanging out on Twitter and enjoying my life in general. 

I love coding and Linux, anything about it. My first interaction with Linux was in second year of under-graduation during Scheme (yeah, you read it right!). I immediately fall in love with it. Unlike most of my classmates, I started using Linux for my daily work, not just for assignments. I learned a lot in the process. I did have to spend a lot of time just hacking around in Linux, to reach this level. That reflects in my CGPA too :innocent:.

As for writing, I started following some of the alumni of NIT Calicut. One [person](http://kartik.in.net), especially caught my attention. You should read his blog. It is amazing. I credit him for my inspiration to start blogging. Other motivation was to document some of my life experiences, so that somebody else can take benefit, just like I got benefit from Kartik's blog.

Now that you know a lot about me, go ahead, and read some of the stuff on this blog and write a comment for me.

And add me to your [RSS](/index.xml) reader.
