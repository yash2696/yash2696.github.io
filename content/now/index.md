> Now is when it all happens. 

Every Sunday, I update this page with a few things that have the majority of my time and attention right now and in the upcoming week.

(You can learn more about [/now](http://nownownow.com/about) pages here.)

## 2020, Week 16
I have never liked the company of others, but this extended period of home quarantine has changed that. I miss the outside environment where I can be surrounded by people and activity but not engaging directly with any of it; I miss the busy-ness of the world.

I am trying to --
- SURVIVE!
- improve this site and converting my knowledge into words.
- re-establish my routing after this indefinite work from home situation.
- practice meditation and being mindful about actions and surroundings.
