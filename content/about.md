Hi, I am Yash ([y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4)) 🙏.

I am a computer programmer 👨‍💻 interested in network security 🛡, cryptography 🔐, and distributed systems 🌐.

You can find me elsewhere on the Web; at places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yash__here), [Github](https://github.com/yashhere) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theyashagarwal). There is also my [email](mailto:yashagarwaljpr+blog@gmail.com) 📩.

I took inspiration from tufte-css while developing this website in 2020. This website has a lot of nice features like partial IndieWeb support, fully responsive design, high lighthouse scores etc. But as the web has transtitioned at a rapid pace, a static site generator like Hugo can't keep with the pace without support of JavaScript. So, I decided to move to NextJs in June 2023. I will keep this website hosted on this [subdomain](https://tufte.yashagarwal.in) for nostalgic purposes.

**I maintain a separate [website](https://highlights.yashagarwal.in/) for storing my Kindle Paperwhite Highlights. Check it out!!**
