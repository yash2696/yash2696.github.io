Hi, I am Yash ([y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4)) 🙏. 

I am a computer programmer 👨‍💻 interested in network security 🛡, cryptography 🔐, and distributed systems 🌐. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering 🎓 at National Institute of Technology, Calicut in 2018.

I work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore. I joined Cisco in August 2018 after completing my B.Tech. My work revolves around developing POCs for integrating existing Cisco Security products with various Security and DevOps tools and products developed by the open-source community, start-ups, and enterprises. My current work roughly falls in the category of DevOps and Security.

I was always interested in learning Computer Science, even though I did not know what Computer Science *actually* is. My first interaction with a computer 🖥️ was in September 2008 when I somehow convinced 🙏 my father 👨 to buy me a PC. As I had no guidance and no internet, I mostly utilized that system for playing games 🕹and installing Windows every few days. I wish somebody had given me a book 📖 to learn some programming language.

In college, I was introduced to Linux and the fantastic world of the Internet. I believe I have utilized the opportunities given to me quite nicely. Although I was late to the game, I am catching up.

I started reading books 📖 seriously in 2018. I feel I have become much better after starting this *ritual*. My thought process has become more streamlined. I think more clearly, and I have learned some good life lessons 👍. In books, I mostly like to read non-fiction, specifically books on economics, history, politics, and science. I read the self-help genre also, but I am somewhat disillusioned by this for some time now. In fiction, I like to read thriller-mythology and fantasy books. My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. 

I am a history and mythology buff. I believe it is imperative to read history so that we do not repeat the same mistakes, people, before us did.

[comment]: # (LEARNING
              Before I realized that I have so little time to do things I wanted to do, I was used to learning everything new and interesting to me, which is a LOT. This is not the only problem caused by my insatiable curiosity, to make my life easier, I’ve learned to put down stuff, things I don’t need the most. I’m still not quite sure if that’s the right thing to do.)
