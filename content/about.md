Hi, I am Yash ([y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4)).

I am a computer programmer 👨‍💻 interested in network security 🛡, cryptography 🔐, and distributed systems 🌐. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering 🎓 at National Institute of Technology, Calicut in 2018.

I work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore. I joined Cisco ⛅ in August, 2018 after completing my B.Tech. My work revolves around developing POCs for integrating existing Cisco Security products with various Security and DevOps tools and products developed by open-source community, start-ups and enterprises 💰. My current work roughly falls in the category of DevOps and Security.

I was always interested in learning Computer Science, even though I did not know, what Computer Science *actually* is. My first interaction with a computer 🖥️ was in September, 2008 when I somehow convinced 🙏 my father 👨 to buy me a computer. As I had no guidance, and no internet, I mostly utilised that system for playing games 🕹, and installing Windows every few days. I wish, somebody had told given me a book 📖 to learn some programming language.



In college, I was introduced to Linux, Open-source and amazing world of Internet. I believe, I have utilized the opportunities given to me quite nicely. Although, I was late to the game, I am catching up. 🃏

I started reading books 📖 📗 seriously in 2018. I think, I have become much better after starting this step. My thought process has become more streamlined 😀. I think more clearly and I have learned some good life lessons 👍. In books, I mostly like to read non-fiction, specifically books on economics, history, politics, and science. I read self-help genre also, but I am somewhat dissillusioned by this for sometime now. In fiction, I like to read thriller-mythology, and fantasy books. My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 🏰. 

I am also a history buff and mythology buff 📜. I believe, it is imperative 💣 to read history so that we do not repeat the same mistakes, people before us did 🔃.

You can find me elsewhere on the Web; places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yash__here), [Github](https://github.com/yashhere) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theyashagarwal). There is also my [email](mailto:yashagarwaljpr+blog@gmail.com) 📩.

**I keep a [now](/now) page updated with my current projects, favourite tools, and a lot of other stuff.**

My resume is [here](/pdf/resume.pdf), but I am not looking for a new job right now.
