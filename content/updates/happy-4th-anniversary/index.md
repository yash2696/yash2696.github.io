Yesterday was the 4th anniversary of this blog. On 3rd April, in 2016, I posted first article on this blog. Since then, this blog and its design have gone through many changes. The latest iteration was just a few days back. I also experimented with a CMS (content management systems) like Wordpress and a variety of SSGs (static site generators) such as Jekyll, Pelican, and Hugo. For the majority of the last 3 years, I have stayed with Hugo, solely because of simplicity and incredibly fast build speeds.

On that day, I was randomly searching the web and found a software called *Wordpress*. Setting up a webpage was a very fascinating idea to me at that time (it still is!). *Hostinger.in* used to provide a basic hosting service for free. As I was in college, I was eligible to get *Github Education pack* and with that came a free `.me` domain on Namecheap. My first domain name was *theyashagarwal.me*.

Even though I was on the verge of getting a fail grade in the Algorithms course, I could not resist my self from setting up this blog. I regret that I didn't take a screenshot of my previous themes. Those screenshots might have been an excellent addition to this post.

*Better late than never.* Above is the screenshot of the website as it looks today.

I hope to keep saying this page my web home for years to come... :smile:
