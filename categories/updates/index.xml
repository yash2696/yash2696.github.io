      <description>I first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in my second year (2016). It was quite fascinating to know that such a program exists (possibly because of that super attractive amount of money, $5500 at that time). I researched about it and sent emails to some mentors. The replies were mostly encouraging, but I still could not gather the courage to apply as I used to doubt my capabilities.</description>

      <description>Today, I deactivated my Facebook account again. For last few days, I started feeling that I am using Facebook excessively. That was affecting some other works. It was even affecting my public life. I was using Facebook day in and day out. Today when I woke up in the morning, I first opened Facebook and didn&amp;rsquo;t leave my bed for one hour. I realized that I have wasted one hour merely browsing through useless stuff.</description>

      <title>My New Domain</title>

      <description>I bought a new domain a few days back - yashagarwal.in. I was trying to buy this domain for last two years, but it was already taken. My previous domain, yashagarwal.me that I got for free via GitHub education pack was good enough for me, but the thought that I own a domain which is a top-level domain of some other country was in itself something which I was not comfortable with.</description>
