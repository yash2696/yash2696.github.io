      <description>I bought a new domain a few days back - yashagarwal.in. I was trying to buy this domain for last two years, but it was already taken. My previous domain, yashagarwal.me that I got for free via GitHub education pack was good enough for me, but the thought that I own a domain which is a top-level domain of some other country was in itself something which I was not comfortable with.</description>
