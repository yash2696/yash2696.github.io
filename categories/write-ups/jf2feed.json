I finished the year with 28 books. Out of 12 months, I did not read any book in January, November, and December. I finished two of the fiction series that I wanted to read for years - Harry Potter, and Percy Jackson. These two books are the reasons that I was able to finish 28 books in 9 months.

I used to get sudden motivations for a few days, I wrote during those periods. The rest of the time, I just thought that I should write.

It is probably because I am not exploring enough after\njoining the corporate world. In\ncollege, I used Linux all the time, but now it is nearly four months since I last booted Linux in my system.

I saw many ups and downs, many successes, and many failures faced many challenges on the personal front and struggled to keep myself on track. I have been working hard on improving my lifestyle (not materialistically) for the last few years, and the benefits have begun to show up now. This year was a pinnacle in that aspect. A lot of micro changes happened in my life this year.\nI often read my blog posts from last year. Reading these posts give me a good feeling about the improvements that I could bring in myself during the previous three years. Writing year reviews and posts like this, this and this serve as documents of my deeds from past for my future. It helps me in not repeating the same mistakes. As a human being, I cannot run away from committing mistakes, but I can always make sure that I do not repeat the same mistakes.\n Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n Blogging \u0026amp; Writing I had set a target to write 15 blog articles at the beginning of this year. In the end, I managed to achieve this goal. I managed to write 17 blog posts and six book reviews. My blog managed to get much traffic this year, mainly thanks to some of my technical posts.\nI got some good responses from people about my technical blog posts. My aim to start writing technical posts was to keep an account of what I learn. It feels very nice when I go back to my posts to read how I did something last time. So I consider myself successful that at least I could benefit from my writing.\nThough, in 2018, after leaving college, the frequency of technical posts on this blog has dipped to almost zero. It is probably because I am not exploring enough after joining the corporate world. In college, I used Linux all the time, but now it is nearly four months since I last booted Linux in my system. I think it is yet another phase of my learning, and I will take some time adjusting with this. I have some lovely technical post ideas, and I hope that I will be able to articulate them soon next year.\nReading For most of the year, I did not pay any heed to books, and I was never very interested in buying books. However, at the end of October, I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite. I consider this to be the best investment done by me this year. Since buying it, I have read eight books. I finally managed to finish my Goodreads reading challenge of 10 books. Although I could not finish one book and included one audiobook to this challenge to complete my target on time.\nThis year, I discovered my interest in Economics. I am reading some economics-related literature lately. It is a subtle shift from my all-CS life. I plan to read a lot of economics-related books in 2019 to gain more expertise in this domain. But I still need to figure out a way to stop it from interfering with my first (or second, maybe!) love.\nSome of my favorite reads from this year (not in any particular order) -\n  Technology / CS\n Branch Prediction The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine In defence of swap: common misconceptions A few things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about computer networking Using Go as a scripting language in Linux Maximize Cache Performance with this One Weird Trick: An Introduction to Cache-Oblivious Data Structures IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT The ``Clockwise/Spiral Rule\u0026rsquo;' A successful Git branching model So, should you do a CS degree?

Although I was never very consistent in reading those saved articles, it was still a good exercise. I finished all my pending pile of saved articles by the end of the year. Moreover, for this post, it became straightforward for me to recollect those links. This list grew excessively large, but I did not want to lose any of these links because of some random third-party service shutting down, so I am adding them here for easy reference in the future.\nNext year onwards, I plan to read one academic paper from my favorite areas of CS in every two weeks and summarise them to improve my understanding of the domain (the readings section of my blog was initially intended for this purpose). Moreover, seeing my experience in the last two months, I feel encouraged to increase my Goodreads reading challenge to 20 books.\nWork The year 2018 was a pivotal year for me on this front. It was the year when I had to come out of the comfort zone of my parents\u0026rsquo; protection. My professional life began this year, and I started earning MONEY. It feels delightful when you see the money gets deposited to your bank account every month for the hard(!) work that you have done for the last one month. But\n With great power comes great responsibility.\n I believe that I have been able to control this feeling of power quite nicely until now. Probably being an Agarwal helped :P\nComing back to work, those who do not know, I joined Cisco Systems this year as a Software Engineer. The job is pretty good for my initial expectations. I made some good friends. First time in my life, I managed to make a group of friends.\nQuite an achievement.\nStudies This year was officially my last year in formal education. Although I failed to finish my bachelors with a satisfactory final GPA (at least I am not happy with it), I am very much satisfied with all my learnings from college. I learned many life lessons, kept myself in check, built some useful contacts, learned a lot about many CS-related things, and ended up with a decent job in the end.\nHowever, I sense that this is not the happy ending of my journey towards learning, and I have a lot more to learn. I recently read the book \u0026ldquo;The Alchemist,\u0026rdquo; and the central theme of this book is to keep looking for your legend. I am still searching for my legend. In 2019, I expect to find new ways to keep learning and explore new areas both in CS and other fields of life.\nRelationships Before this year, I had an assumption that I lack social skills. I hesitated in talking to people. I decided to change it this year. I was waiting for a change in my life, probably because NITC had become too monotonous for me. It was one of my new year\u0026rsquo;s resolution that I will change myself and become more approachable to people.\nI do not know if I have changed or not, but I feel much more confident now than ever in communicating with people. I hope I will continue to improve in 2019 as well.\nSocial Media I was trying to get rid of Facebook for quite some time. This year, I finally managed to control my addiction. For a good part of the year, either my Facebook account remained deactivated, or I was logged out of it. In the past, I used to feel a strong urge to open Facebook every ten minutes, but this year, I was able to keep this urge in control.

Technology itself is a significant distraction, but because I am a CS professional, this is one thing from which I cannot run away. However, I will still try to avoid getting distracted by my curiosity and put more focus on doing work.\nI am writing more than ever. However, with my increased writing, my English vocabulary is not enough anymore. This year, it happened many times that I wanted to write something, but because of the lack of proper words in my vocabulary, I had to settle with inferior words.

I learned a lot of new life lessons, but there were some decisions that I could have avoided.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/06/mistakes-that-i-made-in-nitc/"},{"content":{"html":"\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/photoswipe.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-sCl5PUOGMLfFYctzDW3MtRib0ctyUvI9Qsmq2wXOeBY=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/default-skin/default-skin.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-BFeI1V+Vh1Rk37wswuOYn5lsTcaU96hGaI7OUVCLjPc=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/photoswipe.min.d780348a887d97b4d6cc664301a2941706e4a02aeb1533524fcce3b7b9b64b4f.css\"\u003e\n\n    \n\n    \n    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__bg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__scroll-wrap\"\u003e\n            \n            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__container\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \n            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__ui pswp__ui--hidden\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__top-bar\"\u003e\n                    \n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__counter\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--close\" title=\"Close (Esc)\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--share\" title=\"Share\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--fs\" title=\"Toggle fullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--zoom\" title=\"Zoom in/out\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \n                    \n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader\"\u003e\n                        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__icn\"\u003e\n                            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__cut\"\u003e\n                                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__donut\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\n                        \u003c/div\u003e\n                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__share-modal pswp__share-modal--hidden pswp__single-tap\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__share-tooltip\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--arrow--left\" title=\"Previous (arrow left)\"\u003e\n                \u003c/button\u003e\n                \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--arrow--right\" title=\"Next (arrow right)\"\u003e\n                \u003c/button\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__caption\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__caption__center\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in my second year (2016).

It has been almost one and a half months since the last edition of FOSSMeet is over. I have been a part of FOSSMeet both as a participant and a volunteer. I want to share some of my observations, views, and suggestions through this post. I intend to keep a memory of my most favorite event of NIT Calicut. Juniors can read this post and think about ways to improve FOSSCell and FOSSMeet. I did the same by reading Kartik\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://techglider.in/post/2013/04/14/of-fossmeets-at-nit-calicut/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003epost\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I start, if you have not read my \u003cem\u003epost\u003c/em\u003e on the 2017 edition of the FOSSMeet, it is a good time to read that first. This post is going to be a follow up from where I stopped that post. \u003ca href=\"/posts/2017/03/fossmeet17/\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is the link to that post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll start by quoting some lines from the last paragraph of that article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were my views after last year\u0026rsquo;s FOSSMeet. I felt that I was not getting any benefit from volunteering for FOSSMeet. It is one thing that you help conducting an event, but on a personal level, I was not learning much. I wanted to attend talks and learn about free software philosophies, but because I was busy volunteering for workshops in \u003cem\u003eSSL\u003c/em\u003e, I could not participate in any lecture. So I wanted to make sure that in my last FOSSMeet, I do attend all the talks and learn something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut fate had its plans for me. Few days after writing that post, Simsar, the coordinator of FOSSMeet \u0026lsquo;17, came to my room and asked me if I would like to become the next secretary of FOSSCell. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FOSSCell is the group of people in NITC, who are supposed to work on free and open-source contribution. But it is not very active for the last few years. Probably the seniors decided to give me a chance because I was quite active in providing my suggestions for the FOSSCell when I was in the third year and had shown my intentions to reinitiate FOSSCell. Anyway, I was not very enthusiastic about this opportunity and \u003cem\u003erefused\u003c/em\u003e to accept it. I thought that the topic was closed and did not bother about it much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward two months, I was at home thinking about the reasons that I could not get an internship were. I figured out some reasons (a topic reserved for a later post!) and decided that whatever happens, I will not commit these mistakes again. A few days later, Simsar messaged me on WhatsApp, asking whether I am still interested in the post of secretary. This time, I immediately accepted his offer. I was under the influence of my learnings from past mistakes. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I became the unexpected (at least for my batchmates) secretary of FOSSCell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was placed in the first few days of placement season, so I was free on that front. CSEA had conducted a Debian packaging workshop at the very beginning of the semester, but I could not attend that workshop. So I messaged Pirate Praveen sir privately and asked him whether he can guide me about Debian packaging. As with most of the senior open source contributors, he was very enthusiastic about helping me. So that\u0026rsquo;s how I restarted my journey in open source. It was a fun time learning about free software ideology from Pirate Praveen. We decided to conduct a small Debian Packaging hackathon in NITC. As it is a norm in CSE NITC nowadays about any such activity, people did not turn up at all for this hackathon. Only five people showed up for the hackathon. That was disappointing. Though, on a personal level, I was satisfied. I submitted two packages to the Debian unstable repository. We did not have any other activity for the remaining of that semester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, enough of the background!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-observations\"\u003eMy Observations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe opted for the \u003ca href=\"https://talkfunnel.com\"\u003eHasGeek\u0026rsquo;s Funnel\u003c/a\u003e for the proposal acceptance this time also. The funnel works quite well for our workflow. We did not get many \u003ca href=\"https://fossmeet-nitc.talkfunnel.com/2018\"\u003eproposals\u003c/a\u003e in the beginning. I had read somewhere on the web that FOSSMeet had a MiniDebConf once. That seemed like an excellent idea to the team. So I talked with Praveen sir, about the possibility of a separate Debian track during FOSSMeet. I thought that Debian packaging might be a good and easy way to introduce NITC students to Open-source software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn previous editions of FOSSMeets, the organizers used to receive the \u003ca href=\"http://techglider.in/post/2013/04/14/of-fossmeets-at-nit-calicut/\"\u003efeedback\u003c/a\u003e that the student audience is entirely novice for some sessions and the supposedly advanced session turned out to be a beginner session. We were well aware of this problem and thought of a way to solve this. The solution may be a controversial one because even I have mixed feelings about this solution. We decided to look at the GitHub profiles of each participant and then select a few participants rather than allowing each and everyone who is paying money to attend the FOSSMeet. Our experience from last year was awful in this aspect. Students from various colleges of Kerala came to FOSSMeet just to get the certificate. Such an audience was not contributing anything to FOSSMeet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let me explain why I think that this is not the right way to filter good participants. If I am not wrong, one motive behind organizing such \u003cem\u003estudent run conferences\u003c/em\u003e is to inspire beginners and college students to learn about free and open-source software and to allow them to learn about new technologies. Now, it should not matter if the person has any prior experience or not. In our case, we prioritized the \u003cem\u003eprevious experience\u003c/em\u003e part and neglected \u003cem\u003ethe will to learn\u003c/em\u003e. I know that it is tough to identify if a person is really interested in the event or just coming for the certificate, but still, there must be some better way to solve this issue. For now, this method is the best option available, and it worked well enough for our purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to allow only 150 participants was an excellent move. We had decided not to have parallel workshops and talks. This decision was a direct outcome of some of the bad feedback from the previous FOSSMeets. The decisions to check GitHub profiles and to restrict the number of participants made sure that this edition of FOSSMeet has the most appropriate (read qualified) audience for any session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe publicized the event among CSED\u0026rsquo;s first years. We even had a beginner level Git workshop for them. We were expecting that they will come to take part in the event. These events provide excellent opportunities for newcomers to learn about Computer Science and its various fields. I used to give priority to a CSEA event over any cultural event when I was in my first year. But, the turnout of first-year students for FOSSMeet was very less. I sometimes worry, how are these people going to continue organizing FOSSMeet. In the end, conducting this event will become a burden (of carrying a legacy) for them, and they will hold this event just like any other useless event that happens in NITC every weekend. We even made the entry, free for them; still, if they don\u0026rsquo;t feel interested in the event, then they are at an apparent loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne other complaint that we received from the community was that the procedure of selecting proposals from the funnel is not transparent. \u003cem\u003eIn my opinion\u003c/em\u003e, it is true. The organizing team of FOSSMeet sit together and choose the topics based on the relevance of the topics and its relation to FOSS ideologies. Most of the proposals in the funnel were related to some technology or programming language. We aimed to give a chance to the talks which explain more about free software in general. Most of the proposals selected this year revolved around this theme with one or two exceptions. But I think it might be a good idea to publicly tell the factors that are taken into account while selecting proposals. FOSSMeet is an event about free software and the community, and it is the responsibility of the organizers to make sure that they adhere to the ideologies of free software, including transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to select philosophical topics might seem like a great thing. Still, in reality, the student audience is not very interested in listening to some random guy preaching about something which is not very relevant to them. Students want more technical knowledge, which they can get only from technical talks and workshops. I hope that future FOSSMeet organizers will be more careful about maintaining the right balance between technical and not technical discussions and workshops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome students from Amrita college complained about our selection of the same speakers every year. In my opinion, it is a very valid complaint. In my last three FOSSMeets, almost 3-5 speakers are giving talks/workshops every year. I am not saying that it is bad in any way, but the organizing team can start a bit early and invite some other prominent faces of the field from different parts of the country. The issue is that we begin contacting speakers very late and the people coming from far corners of the country or from abroad get very little time for making arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used to have panel discussions in FOSSMeet. For the last two years, we stopped having one. I think that a panel discussion is a great way to learn about different viewpoints of experienced people. It will be good if the future organizers can squeeze one such panel discussion in the FOSSMeet schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow coming to my memories of this edition of the event, I liked the video conference by Bradley M Kuhn, the president of the Software Freedom Conservancy. The way he explained current issues in software freedom was fascinating. I was amazed by his humbleness. I was looking forward to the talk by RMS, but he could not deliver his speech due to some technical issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn a lighter note\u003c/strong\u003e, It feels strange when you are working in a team where everyone except you speaks a language that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I know that it is a very natural behavior, and I have no \u003cem\u003ecomplains\u003c/em\u003e about it. But in my opinion, language is a tool of communication, and when you are not able to communicate your views to others, then there is some problem. When I think about these issues, I admire the forefathers of India for their farsightedness to make a \u003cem\u003eforeign\u003c/em\u003e but \u003cem\u003euniversal\u003c/em\u003e language, one of the official languages of the Republic of India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel at a loss because I got the chance to attend only three FOSSMeets (2015 edition never came to reality). It has been a great experience both as a participant and a volunteer for me over the last three years. I have written two posts about FOSSMeets and have tried to cover everything which I liked or disliked about this event. I might be very \u003cem\u003ebiased\u003c/em\u003e in the views expressed here as I was very disappointed with the lack of any activity from the FOSSCell side to introduce students about open source contributions. My \u003cem\u003elack\u003c/em\u003e of good communication skills made sure that the trend continues in my tenure also.

It has been almost one and a half months since the last edition of FOSSMeet is over. I have been a part of FOSSMeet both as a participant and a volunteer. I want to share some of my observations, views, and suggestions through this post. I intend to keep a memory of my most favorite event of NIT Calicut. Juniors can read this post and think about ways to improve FOSSCell and FOSSMeet. I did the same by reading Kartik\u0026rsquo;s post.\nBefore I start, if you have not read my post on the 2017 edition of the FOSSMeet, it is a good time to read that first. This post is going to be a follow up from where I stopped that post. Here is the link to that post.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start by quoting some lines from the last paragraph of that article.\n I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\n These were my views after last year\u0026rsquo;s FOSSMeet. I felt that I was not getting any benefit from volunteering for FOSSMeet. It is one thing that you help conducting an event, but on a personal level, I was not learning much. I wanted to attend talks and learn about free software philosophies, but because I was busy volunteering for workshops in SSL, I could not participate in any lecture. So I wanted to make sure that in my last FOSSMeet, I do attend all the talks and learn something new.\nBut fate had its plans for me. Few days after writing that post, Simsar, the coordinator of FOSSMeet \u0026lsquo;17, came to my room and asked me if I would like to become the next secretary of FOSSCell. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FOSSCell is the group of people in NITC, who are supposed to work on free and open-source contribution. But it is not very active for the last few years. Probably the seniors decided to give me a chance because I was quite active in providing my suggestions for the FOSSCell when I was in the third year and had shown my intentions to reinitiate FOSSCell. Anyway, I was not very enthusiastic about this opportunity and refused to accept it. I thought that the topic was closed and did not bother about it much.\nFast forward two months, I was at home thinking about the reasons that I could not get an internship were. I figured out some reasons (a topic reserved for a later post!) and decided that whatever happens, I will not commit these mistakes again. A few days later, Simsar messaged me on WhatsApp, asking whether I am still interested in the post of secretary. This time, I immediately accepted his offer. I was under the influence of my learnings from past mistakes. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I became the unexpected (at least for my batchmates) secretary of FOSSCell.\nI was placed in the first few days of placement season, so I was free on that front. CSEA had conducted a Debian packaging workshop at the very beginning of the semester, but I could not attend that workshop. So I messaged Pirate Praveen sir privately and asked him whether he can guide me about Debian packaging. As with most of the senior open source contributors, he was very enthusiastic about helping me. So that\u0026rsquo;s how I restarted my journey in open source. It was a fun time learning about free software ideology from Pirate Praveen. We decided to conduct a small Debian Packaging hackathon in NITC. As it is a norm in CSE NITC nowadays about any such activity, people did not turn up at all for this hackathon. Only five people showed up for the hackathon. That was disappointing. Though, on a personal level, I was satisfied. I submitted two packages to the Debian unstable repository. We did not have any other activity for the remaining of that semester.\nOkay, enough of the background!\nMy Observations We opted for the HasGeek\u0026rsquo;s Funnel for the proposal acceptance this time also. The funnel works quite well for our workflow. We did not get many proposals in the beginning. I had read somewhere on the web that FOSSMeet had a MiniDebConf once. That seemed like an excellent idea to the team. So I talked with Praveen sir, about the possibility of a separate Debian track during FOSSMeet. I thought that Debian packaging might be a good and easy way to introduce NITC students to Open-source software.\nIn previous editions of FOSSMeets, the organizers used to receive the feedback that the student audience is entirely novice for some sessions and the supposedly advanced session turned out to be a beginner session. We were well aware of this problem and thought of a way to solve this. The solution may be a controversial one because even I have mixed feelings about this solution. We decided to look at the GitHub profiles of each participant and then select a few participants rather than allowing each and everyone who is paying money to attend the FOSSMeet. Our experience from last year was awful in this aspect. Students from various colleges of Kerala came to FOSSMeet just to get the certificate. Such an audience was not contributing anything to FOSSMeet.\nNow, let me explain why I think that this is not the right way to filter good participants. If I am not wrong, one motive behind organizing such student run conferences is to inspire beginners and college students to learn about free and open-source software and to allow them to learn about new technologies. Now, it should not matter if the person has any prior experience or not. In our case, we prioritized the previous experience part and neglected the will to learn. I know that it is tough to identify if a person is really interested in the event or just coming for the certificate, but still, there must be some better way to solve this issue. For now, this method is the best option available, and it worked well enough for our purpose.\nThe decision to allow only 150 participants was an excellent move. We had decided not to have parallel workshops and talks. This decision was a direct outcome of some of the bad feedback from the previous FOSSMeets. The decisions to check GitHub profiles and to restrict the number of participants made sure that this edition of FOSSMeet has the most appropriate (read qualified) audience for any session.\nWe publicized the event among CSED\u0026rsquo;s first years. We even had a beginner level Git workshop for them. We were expecting that they will come to take part in the event. These events provide excellent opportunities for newcomers to learn about Computer Science and its various fields. I used to give priority to a CSEA event over any cultural event when I was in my first year. But, the turnout of first-year students for FOSSMeet was very less. I sometimes worry, how are these people going to continue organizing FOSSMeet. In the end, conducting this event will become a burden (of carrying a legacy) for them, and they will hold this event just like any other useless event that happens in NITC every weekend. We even made the entry, free for them; still, if they don\u0026rsquo;t feel interested in the event, then they are at an apparent loss.\nOne other complaint that we received from the community was that the procedure of selecting proposals from the funnel is not transparent. In my opinion, it is true. The organizing team of FOSSMeet sit together and choose the topics based on the relevance of the topics and its relation to FOSS ideologies. Most of the proposals in the funnel were related to some technology or programming language. We aimed to give a chance to the talks which explain more about free software in general. Most of the proposals selected this year revolved around this theme with one or two exceptions. But I think it might be a good idea to publicly tell the factors that are taken into account while selecting proposals. FOSSMeet is an event about free software and the community, and it is the responsibility of the organizers to make sure that they adhere to the ideologies of free software, including transparency.\nThe decision to select philosophical topics might seem like a great thing. Still, in reality, the student audience is not very interested in listening to some random guy preaching about something which is not very relevant to them. Students want more technical knowledge, which they can get only from technical talks and workshops. I hope that future FOSSMeet organizers will be more careful about maintaining the right balance between technical and not technical discussions and workshops.\nSome students from Amrita college complained about our selection of the same speakers every year. In my opinion, it is a very valid complaint. In my last three FOSSMeets, almost 3-5 speakers are giving talks/workshops every year. I am not saying that it is bad in any way, but the organizing team can start a bit early and invite some other prominent faces of the field from different parts of the country. The issue is that we begin contacting speakers very late and the people coming from far corners of the country or from abroad get very little time for making arrangements.\nWe used to have panel discussions in FOSSMeet. For the last two years, we stopped having one. I think that a panel discussion is a great way to learn about different viewpoints of experienced people. It will be good if the future organizers can squeeze one such panel discussion in the FOSSMeet schedule.\nNow coming to my memories of this edition of the event, I liked the video conference by Bradley M Kuhn, the president of the Software Freedom Conservancy. The way he explained current issues in software freedom was fascinating. I was amazed by his humbleness. I was looking forward to the talk by RMS, but he could not deliver his speech due to some technical issues.\nOn a lighter note, It feels strange when you are working in a team where everyone except you speaks a language that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I know that it is a very natural behavior, and I have no complains about it. But in my opinion, language is a tool of communication, and when you are not able to communicate your views to others, then there is some problem. When I think about these issues, I admire the forefathers of India for their farsightedness to make a foreign but universal language, one of the official languages of the Republic of India.\nConclusion I feel at a loss because I got the chance to attend only three FOSSMeets (2015 edition never came to reality). It has been a great experience both as a participant and a volunteer for me over the last three years. I have written two posts about FOSSMeets and have tried to cover everything which I liked or disliked about this event. I might be very biased in the views expressed here as I was very disappointed with the lack of any activity from the FOSSCell side to introduce students about open source contributions. My lack of good communication skills made sure that the trend continues in my tenure also. I wish good luck to the next office bearers and hope that they will not continue this trend. 😄\nThanks to all fourth years \u0026ndash; Sajmal, Navaneeth, Nithin, Kumar, Pavithra, Vrushabh, Nitin, and others for making the FOSSMeet a success.

When we started thinking about the FOSSCell, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know about any of these points.

I somehow understood that I was not qualified enough to guide someone about open source contribution or in general FOSS ideology, because I, myself was not contributing anything to open source community, and had no characteristic of a FOSS enthusiast. So I somehow lost my interest in FOSSCell and even in Linux. Shrimadhav asked me my ideas about FOSSCell activities, but I had no clue what to say. So that\u0026rsquo;s how the FOSSCell again died without achieving anything significant. I feel it was my mistake. I still feel sad about this. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fossmeet-time\"\u003eFOSSMeet time\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo as the FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;s dates came near, people started coming for \u003cem\u003evolunteering\u003c/em\u003e. It was good for the event, though. The funnel was already up last semester, and we were getting some good proposals also. FOSSMeet also went superbly. All the participants gave excellent reviews. There were some hiccups also, The Campus Internet Connectivity being the most significant one. There were some issues in SSL also, again, somewhere I hold an important responsibility. All in all, everybody praised the event and organization of the event. This year, we tried to reduce the use of plastics, and I feel that we were quite successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-observations\"\u003eMy Observations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some issues about the event, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like at a personal level. I sometimes think about what is the motive for conducting some activities in colleges. An event like FOSSMeet which attract the attention of all FOSS enthusiasts from all over Kerala has a huge potential of inspiring the young folks of NIT Calicut. We somehow succeed in that motive, but what about the situation after FOSSMeet. The enthusiasm about FOSS should not last just for two days, but we cannot blame others for the condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a proper idea about the FOSS because there was no proper guidance from my senior batches. I learned many things in the workshops organized by CSEA, in fact, I first learned the proper use of Linux Shell in the Linux workshop conducted by CSEA (and FOSSCell, at least for formality). But you can\u0026rsquo;t ask them to do everything. I think they are already overloaded. But there were no such workshops by FOSSCell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, the curriculum of the NITC CSE department focuses more on the theoretical side of Computer Science, which is good. But it negatively affects student activities outside the classroom. That is one of the primary reasons why we cannot produce more GSoC participants or why don\u0026rsquo;t we have more open source enthusiasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird, one of the speakers in FOSSMeet mentioned one fundamental flaw in the structure of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any representation from other branches. FOSSMeet has become an event for CSE folks, where people from different departments do not take any interest. I think publicity was a major issue here. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there was any publicity done to explain FOSSMeet to the students of other branches. (If I am wrong here, please correct me).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth, people are ready to \u003cem\u003evolunteer\u003c/em\u003e for organizing an event, but they do not want to come and attend the workshops. FOSSMeet is held by individuals who have no previous experience of FOSS and have no intention to dive into open source community any time soon. FOSSMeet has become a tradition that is continued every year because it happened the previous year also. I do not feel that enthusiasm to promote FOSS in FOSSMeet because we are organizing it to keep the legacy. I am not saying that whatever effort organizers put in conducting FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was not significant. I am not the right person to blame them because I was also part of the same team. But still, I feel that FOSSMeet has lost its original motive to promote FOSS culture in NITC. It encourages more people from outside NITC, but inside NITC, it is just one of those many events organized by random clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been an interesting one year for me after becoming SS Lab Admin because I started taking part in department activities that I always wanted to do. Being a member of the organizing team of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was again a learning experience for me. I learned many new things, in SSL and outside SSL too. I committed some mistakes also in making the right decisions at the right moment, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I learn. So no regrets. :) I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"One more edition of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was successfully organized in NIT Calicut recently.

We somehow succeed in that motive, but what about the situation after FOSSMeet. The enthusiasm about FOSS should not last just for two days, but we cannot blame others for the condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a proper idea about the FOSS because there was no proper guidance from my senior batches. I learned many things in the workshops organized by CSEA, in fact, I first learned the proper use of Linux Shell in the Linux workshop conducted by CSEA (and FOSSCell, at least for formality). But you can\u0026rsquo;t ask them to do everything. I think they are already overloaded. But there were no such workshops by FOSSCell.\nSecond, the curriculum of the NITC CSE department focuses more on the theoretical side of Computer Science, which is good. But it negatively affects student activities outside the classroom. That is one of the primary reasons why we cannot produce more GSoC participants or why don\u0026rsquo;t we have more open source enthusiasts.\nThird, one of the speakers in FOSSMeet mentioned one fundamental flaw in the structure of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any representation from other branches. FOSSMeet has become an event for CSE folks, where people from different departments do not take any interest. I think publicity was a major issue here. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there was any publicity done to explain FOSSMeet to the students of other branches. (If I am wrong here, please correct me).\nFourth, people are ready to volunteer for organizing an event, but they do not want to come and attend the workshops. FOSSMeet is held by individuals who have no previous experience of FOSS and have no intention to dive into open source community any time soon. FOSSMeet has become a tradition that is continued every year because it happened the previous year also. I do not feel that enthusiasm to promote FOSS in FOSSMeet because we are organizing it to keep the legacy. I am not saying that whatever effort organizers put in conducting FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was not significant. I am not the right person to blame them because I was also part of the same team. But still, I feel that FOSSMeet has lost its original motive to promote FOSS culture in NITC. It encourages more people from outside NITC, but inside NITC, it is just one of those many events organized by random clubs.\nConclusion It\u0026rsquo;s been an interesting one year for me after becoming SS Lab Admin because I started taking part in department activities that I always wanted to do. Being a member of the organizing team of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was again a learning experience for me. I learned many new things, in SSL and outside SSL too. I committed some mistakes also in making the right decisions at the right moment, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I learn. So no regrets. :) I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\n"},"name":"FOSSMeet'17","published":"2017-03-13T21:03:16Z","summary":"One more edition of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was successfully organized in NIT Calicut recently. As an active member of the organizing team of this year\u0026rsquo;s edition (though I sidelined myself at the end) and a keen but silent observer, I want to share my experience, ideas, and some observations through this post.\nMarketing Website We started planning the next edition of FOSSMeet sometime around September. Not many people were interested in planning. Anyway, Shrimadhav and I began working on the marketing website.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2017/03/fossmeet17/"}],"name":"Write-ups","type":"feed","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/categories/write-ups/"}
