      <description>श्रूयतां धर्मसर्वस्वं श्रुत्वा चाप्यवधार्यताम्।
आत्मनः प्रतिकूलानि परेषां न समाचरेत्।। If the entire Dharma can be said in a few words, then it is — that which is unfavorable to us, do not do that to others.
— Padmapuraana, shrushti 19/357–358

One fine day, suddenly his friend&amp;#8217;s mother asked, &amp;#8220; So what about the future? You are going to enter in class 11th. It is the right time to decide about your future. What do you want to become, a doctor or an engineer?</description>
