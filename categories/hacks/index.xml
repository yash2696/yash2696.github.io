      <title>Battery Notifications in i3</title>

      <description>I am using i3 window manager for last seven months, and it has been a pleasant and productive experience so far. There were a few hiccups here and there, but that is expected with such minimalistic setups. One thing that I never noticed was the lack of notifications on critical battery levels. For last few months, my laptop battery was discharging to 0% all the time. Probably this proved to be too fatal for my battery.</description>

      <description>This post is going to be one among those, that I have written for my own reference. Whatever I am going to mention in this post, is not new. Everything has already been said and written many times on many websites and Linux forums.
So I will start with explaining the problem. When you try to dual boot your machine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have noticed that the time is not same in both the operating systems.</description>

      <title>Arch Linux Installation Guide Part 2</title>
      <link>https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/01/arch-linux-installation-guide-part-2/</link>

      <description>In this post, I will continue from my last post and set up my newly installed Arch Linux for daily use. I am going to install some applications that I use on a day to day basis. Some of these applications are required for my current configuration setup to work properly. The choice of applications is highly opinionated and your preferences might be different.
Note: If you had gone for installation via SSH option, then I would suggest you to edit your sshd_config file and disable root login.</description>

      <title>Arch Linux Installation Guide Part 1</title>
      <link>https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/01/arch-linux-installation-guide-part-1/</link>

      <description>Arch Linux is a Linux distribution known for its not-so-beginner-friendly command line installer, no ready-to-use system after installation and requirement of above average knowledge of command line. However, Arch Linux allows me to set up a system in my desired state in shortest possible time with least effort. This is why I keep coming back to Arch Linux even after some of its annoyances.
This guide is written primarily for my reference, as someone who has installed Arch Linux several times, I still can&amp;rsquo;t remember all the installation steps perfectly.</description>

      <title>Setting Up SSH Agent in i3</title>
      <link>https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2017/12/setting-up-ssh-agent-in-i3/</link>

      <guid>https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2017/12/setting-up-ssh-agent-in-i3/</guid>
      <description>In this post, I will write about the procedure to correctly setup SSH and GPG agents in the i3 window manager. To follow this post, you need to have ssh-keys and your private GPG keys ready. If you do not already have these keys with you, I will describe the process of creating the keys.
SSH Generating an SSH key pair provides you with a public key and a private key.</description>

      <title>Fixing Hindi Fonts in Arch Linux</title>

      <description>When viewing Hindi content in any browser in Arch Linux, the rendering looks weird.
    before applying the fix
    Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look good right! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to fix this issue in this post. You might need to install the appropriate font support in Arch Linux before applying this fix. The appropriate package for installing Indic Language support is ttf-indic-otf.
Now go to /usr/share/fonts/TTF and take the backup of two fonts FreeSans.</description>

      <title>Mounting NTFS partitions on Arch Linux</title>

      <description>Yesterday I installed Arch Linux once again. A clean, bloat free desktop with Budgie Desktop environment with some must have open source tools. Everything worked fine except WiFi and some minor bugs in Budgie(I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it is a bug in Budgie or just a wrong setting). I also faced the problem of mounting Windows NTFS volumes on user&amp;rsquo;s wish. Arch Linux wiki has details about how to auto mount partitions on start-up, but I had a tough time to find out what exactly needs to be done to simulate the behavior of Ubuntu-like distribution on the mounting of NTFS drives.</description>

      <description>You might have tried many Linux easters eggs for fun, but you are going to love this hack which makes `sudo` insult you. Confused what I am talking about?Â Here, take a look at this gif to get an idea of how `sudo` can insult you for typing in the incorrect password.       Now you might be thinking, why would anyone want to take insult?</description>
