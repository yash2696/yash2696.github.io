      <description>I have had a fair share of failures in my life. Most of what I try fails, but these failures never got the required visibility. People often fail to realize that the world is stochastic and it is not just successes in one&amp;rsquo;s life. This page is an attempt to restore the balance between the two parts of the coin in my life.
This idea is not mine. Recently I read the excellent article in Nature, written by Melanie I.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I am Yash (y-uh-sh) ðŸ‘‹.
I am a computer programmer interested in network security, cryptography, and distributed systems.
I work as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore.
I am interested in tech, economics, books, writing, history and philosophy.
As an introvert, I do not like to talk a lot in public spaces, but one to one is always an option. Contact me for anything and I will be more than happy to help.</description>
