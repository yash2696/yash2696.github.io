All of them preaches to save, not spend, and invest, and I will be rich. This book is no different, but it does provide a simple base upon which, more modern understanding of finance can be built.\nMost of the things described in this book are common knowledge, but many of us tend to overlook them. I liked the simple and lucid way in which the author has tried to explain critical financial concepts. Although, I had some difficulty in understanding the archaic English language as it was the first time I came across this variant of English.\nThis book covers fundamental financial concepts which the inhabitants of Babylon used some 8000 years ago. Below are some of the notes that I prepared while reading the book.\nIf I were to write the advice of this book in one sentence, it would be save the money, control the expenditures, invest your money wisely, guard your money against losing, insure a future income and increase your ability to earn.\nFollowing are my detailed notes for each of these topics -\n Save money -  The basic idea here is to save at least one-tenth of your earnings. Learn to live with less than you earn. Control your desires.   Control the expenditures -  Our necessary expenses will always grow to equal our income unless we protest to the contrary. If you want to control your urge to spend, budgeting is an excellent tool. Budget expenses required for your day to day living, to pay for all your enjoyments, and to gratify your worthwhile desires.   Invest your savings -  The first rule of investment says that always save the principal from loss. Ask those who are experts in handling money for advice to secure your savings from the risky venture. Do not get misled by your romantic desires about making wealth rapidly.   Own your own house (this is controversial) Ensure a future income -  Think about the uncertain future and provide in advance for your old age and the needs of your family.   Increase your ability to earn -  Show more interest in your work, more concentration upon your task, and more persistence in your efforts. The more one knows about his craft; more will be the reward.   Seize the opportunities -  Do not procrastinate. It is necessary to take advantage of opportunities to attract good luck. Action will lead you to success.   Better a little caution than a great regret -  If you desire to help a friend, do so in a way that will not bring your friend\u0026rsquo;s burden upon you. Safe loans are those where possessions are more than what is desired.    Some of the quotes from the book which I liked -\n Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you only take what is worth having. If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy friend\u0026rsquo;s burdens upon thyself. Learning was of two kinds: the one being the things we learned and knew, and the other being the training that taught us how to find out what we did not know? The hungrier one becomes, the clearer one\u0026rsquo;s mind worksâ€” also the more sensitive one becomes to the odors of food. As for time, all men have it in abundance. Where the determination is, the way can be found. \u0026lsquo;A part of all I earn is mine to keep.\u0026rsquo; - say it in the morning when you first arise. Say it at noon. Say it at night. Say it each hour of every day. Say it to yourself until the words stand out like letters of fire across the sky. Work, well-done, does good to the man who does it. It makes him a better man. Proper preparation is the key to our success. Our acts can be no wiser than our thoughts. Our thinking can be no wiser than our understanding. Men of action are favored by the goddess of good luck. Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared. Desires must be simple and definite. They defeat their own purpose should they be too many, too confusing, or beyond a man\u0026rsquo;s training to accomplish. One may not condemn a man for succeeding because he knows how. Neither may one with justice take away from a man what he has fairly earned, to give to men of less ability. That what each of us calls our necessary expenses will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary. Better a little caution than a great regret. Our wise acts accompany us through life to please us and to help us. Just as surely, our unwise acts follow us to plague and torment us. Life is hard and there will always be some who cannot adjust themselves to it.

Getting rich is a game of offense, not defense. I believe millionaire is today\u0026rsquo;s new middle class. Do the math to create possibility, then create a strategy. The best ideas are always simple. The creation of wealth is not about saving or investing; it is about creating multiple sources of income. 3/4 millionaires work for somebody else. Lose your middle-class mind and be okay with becoming a millionaire. The more people you help, the more money you will have. Always move your surplus income to some accounts reserved for future investments. Always stay broke, even if you have a lot of money. That way you will never spend more. I watch the pretenders sleep like they are rich while I am up like I am broke. We both deceive ourselves but with very different outcomes. Idea + Hard Work x Long Time + Discipline = Success Stay broke, not poor. Save to Invest, don\u0026rsquo;t save to Save. You should think long and hard before walking away from any income flow. The first sign that you are on your way is when the people close to you start to question why you are working so hard. When you change, you may become a threat to all those who don\u0026rsquo;t. If you are truly committed to becoming a millionaire, you will at some point need to change your environment. One way to find the right people is to continue investing in yourself. Don\u0026rsquo;t spend time and money on things, toys, holidays, or moments, invest in the surest investment of your life \u0026ndash; YOU!

I am entirely new to managing money, so I thought it would be a\ngood idea to gain some knowledge before trying anything crazy. I must say, this book has not disappointed me. I do not\nknow, how other personal-finance books are written, but from my point of view, I learned a lot by reading this\nbook. I have already implemented some of the ideas mentioned in this book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best things that I learned from this book is to automate everything. As a Computer Engineer, it is easily\nrelatable. The author says that if you enable automatic transfers to transfer money from your checking account to\ndifferent accounts, then you will not look at the money, and hence you will not have the urge to spend the money. A\npsychological win, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author argues in favor of passive investment - the buy and hold strategy. One of the main takeaways from this book\nwas just to get started. The author shows that it is better to do something 85% right than to wait for a long time to gain\nperfection.

I am entirely new to managing money, so I thought it would be a good idea to gain some knowledge before trying anything crazy. I must say, this book has not disappointed me. I do not know, how other personal-finance books are written, but from my point of view, I learned a lot by reading this book. I have already implemented some of the ideas mentioned in this book.\nOne of the best things that I learned from this book is to automate everything. As a Computer Engineer, it is easily relatable. The author says that if you enable automatic transfers to transfer money from your checking account to different accounts, then you will not look at the money, and hence you will not have the urge to spend the money. A psychological win, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nThe author argues in favor of passive investment - the buy and hold strategy. One of the main takeaways from this book was just to get started.
