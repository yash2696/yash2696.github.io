      <description>Recently I was searching for Python projects on Github for contribution. Every single project I found, had a thing common among them. In every project&amp;rsquo;s contribution guide, it was asked to set up the virtual environment for the project. What the heck is this virtual environment and how does it work?
As a beginner to open source projects, the problem I faced, in the beginning, was how to set up the development environments for the projects I was looking at.</description>
