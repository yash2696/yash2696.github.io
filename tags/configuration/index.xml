      <description>This article was originally published on zeolearn.
If you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a build script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive parts of the development process. For JavaScript projects, Grunt serves the similar purpose. It is a JavaScript task/build runner that is written on top of NodeJS. Grunt can help you with automatically minifying your JavaScript or CSS files, reload your browser on every file change, can show you a comprehensive list of JavaScript errors, compile your SASS/LESS files into CSS files automatically and many other things.</description>

      <description>This post is going to be one among those, that I have written for my own reference. Whatever I am going to mention in this post, is not new. Everything has already been said and written many times on many websites and Linux forums.
So I will start with explaining the problem. When you try to dual boot your machine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have noticed that the time is not same in both the operating systems.</description>

      <description>I have been using Linux since I was in my second year of undergraduate. My experiments with the dotfiles (configuration files) also started at the same time. For the uninformed, in Linux, it is common to configure a lot of settings and configurations within dotfiles. Dotfiles are files in a Linux user&amp;rsquo;s home directory that begin with a dot or a full-stop character. This dot indicates to the operating system, that these files are used to store the settings of programs like vim or shells like bash or fish to name a few.</description>
