      <description>One more edition of FOSSMeet&amp;rsquo;17 was successfully organized in NIT Calicut recently. As an active member of the organizing team of this year&amp;rsquo;s edition (though I sidelined myself at the end) and a keen but salient observer, I want to share my experience, ideas, and some observations through this post.
Marketing Website We started planning about next edition of FOSSMeet sometime around September. Not many people were interested in the planning.</description>

One fine day, suddenly his friend&amp;#8217;s mother asked, &amp;#8220;So what about the future? You are going to enter in class 11th. It is the right time to decide about your future. What do you want to become, a doctor or an engineer?</description>
