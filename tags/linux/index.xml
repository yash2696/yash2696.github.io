      <title>Fixing Hindi Fonts in Arch Linux</title>

      <description>When viewing Hindi content in any browser in Arch Linux, the rendering looks weird.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look good right! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to fix this issue in this post. You might need to install the appropriate font support in Arch Linux before applying this fix. The appropriate package for installing Indic Language support is ttf-indic-otf.
Now go to /usr/share/fonts/TTF and take the backup of two fonts FreeSans.ttf and FreeSerif.ttf. Now delete these two fonts from the directory.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I installed Arch Linux once again. A clean, bloat free desktop with Budgie Desktop environment with some must have open source tools. Everything worked fine except WiFi and some minor bugs in Budgie(I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it is a bug in Budgie or just a wrong setting). I also faced the problem of mounting Windows NTFS volumes on user&amp;rsquo;s wish. Arch Linux wiki has details about how to auto mount partitions on start-up, but I had a tough time to find out what exactly needs to be done to simulate the behavior of Ubuntu-like distribution on the mounting of NTFS drives.</description>

      <description>After my summer vacation started, I bought a new laptop and the first thing I did was to install Arch Linux on it. After a standard arch installation procedure, I started putting together my own desktop environment starting with ArchLinux and Openbox and then piecing all pieces together to build a proper desktop environment. Building a desktop this way really follows the Unix Methodology; have softwares that each do one thing well, and when you put them together you get something amazing.</description>

      <title>A good Sublime Text Setup</title>

      <description>So, after a hactic day, a good news finally came. I have been selected as a Lab Administrator for the Software Systems Lab of my college. Cheers!!!
Let&amp;#8217;s come to our today&amp;#8217;s topic on configuring Sublime Text Settings.
There is just one rule you must follow while designing your own editor preference configuration.
 Don&amp;#8217;t put any lines in your configuration that you don&amp;#8217;t understand.
 You will find tons of online tutorials that contains all kinds of awesome hacks to make your sublime text experience better but the worst way to make your development environment better is to just borrow the configuration from someone else.</description>

      <title>Wanna get insulted by sudo</title>

      <description>You might have tried many linux easters eggs for fun, but you are going to love this hack which makes sudo insult you. Confused what I am talking about? Here, take a look at this gif to get a idea of how sudo can insult you for typing in the incorrect password. Now you might be thinking, why would anyone want to take insult? Afterall, nobody likes being insulted. For me, it is just another way to have fun with linux, and anyway this is way better than the plain &amp;#8220;You entered a wrong password&amp;#8221; error message.</description>
