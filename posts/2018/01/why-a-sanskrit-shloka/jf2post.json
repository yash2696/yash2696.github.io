Many people ask me, why did I choose to display a Sanskrit shloka on my blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no one answer to this question. There have been several incidents in my undergraduate life, which have given me a lot of good and evil memories. This shloka summarizes all those experiences that I earned in NIT Calicut during my undergraduate course. It reminds me, how I should treat others to receive similar treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my first time away from home and family when I got admission in NIT Calicut. I was very naive about judging people. I got to know many new people in NITC. That is when I learned that not everyone is helping you. People are here to exploit you, and they will do anything to achieve their goals and to get success, whether it comes at the price of someone else\u0026rsquo;s loss. It is the harsh truth of life, and the sooner one understands this, the better. I realized this in my second year, and that is when my life changed. Thankfully, I did not find other such people after my first year. However, life is very long, and I am bound to find such people at some point in my life again. I hope the experience that I earned in NITC will help me face that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, to the second part of the question, why Sanskrit? A quick Google search reveals that this shloka represents the concept of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\"\u003eGolden Rule\u003c/a\u003e, which is common to most world religions, and Hinduism is no exception here.
