My previous domain, \u003cem\u003eyashagarwal.me\u003c/em\u003e that I got for free via GitHub education pack, was good enough for me, but the thought that I own a domain which is a top-level domain of some other country was in itself something which was not comfortable to me.

Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt requires you to renew the SSL certificates every 90 days. That seems like a manual work to me.

I will probably use the DNS based authentication to verify the ownership of my domain, as that seems the only method that does not require any modification on the host side. I will write a post with all the details about the script, once I finish implementing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all for this post. See you next time. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"I bought a new domain a few days back - yashagarwal.in. I was trying to buy this domain for the last two years, but it was already taken.
