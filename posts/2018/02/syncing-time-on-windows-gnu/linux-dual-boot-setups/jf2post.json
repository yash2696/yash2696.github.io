When you try to dual boot your machine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have noticed that the time is not the same in both the operating systems. It is generally one operating system showing the correct time, and the other one showing the wrong time. It happens because Microsoft Windows thinks that the hardware clock (CMOS clock or BIOS clock) of the machine is using the local time (depends on your current time zone), and hence it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything and shows you the same time. But most GNU/Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux, etc.) think that the hardware clock is set to track UTC. Hence the mismatch in the time happens. For example, assume that the current real-time is 10:22:51, and the hardware clock time is set to 10:22:51. Windows will interpret this time as local time and show 10:22:51, but Linux based systems will show 15:52:51 because they will understand this time as UTC. Of course, the above example is true if we assume time zone as India, which is +05:30 from UTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue can be fixed either from Windows or from GNU/Linux OS. I prefer to adjust the behavior of Windows to use UTC. It is much more convenient to use when traveling between different time zones. Please note that this method might not work or cause instability with older versions of Windows OS. I have tried this fix on Windows 10, and it works without any issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen an Administrator Command Prompt by pressing \u003ccode\u003e⊞ + x\u003c/code\u003e, then type \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e.
