None of the themes on the Hugo Themes \u003ca href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e suited my taste. I liked themes (especially those based on \u003cem\u003etufte-css\u003c/em\u003e) on some of the blogs that I follow, but either the themes were made for Jekyll, or their source was not public.

I am not in a state to invest my mental strength fixing such issues right now. I will probably revisit this post sometime later to fix any problem.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been three months since 2020 started. I was not able to keep up with my yearly habit of posting year reviews due to some reasons. One primary reason behind my negligence is my disinterest in writing on this blog. I felt that it was because the old layout of this blog had been too recurrent for me. So, I decided to fix that issue before thinking about writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe year 2019 was not a great year for me on many fronts. It was a year that reminded me of my limitations and brought me out of the bubble, that self-help books created for me. In retrospection, I find that I started a lot of things, with the intention of learning, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t achieve any of the targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike, I structure these posts every year, I have divided this post too in many sections. It makes it easier for me to focus on various aspects of my life in the past year. I will start with the best parts of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reading\"\u003eReading\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had decided to read 26 books in the year. I finished the year with 28 books. Out of 12 months, I did not read any book in January, November, and December. I finished two of the fiction series that I wanted to read for years - Harry Potter, and Percy Jackson. These two books are the reasons that I was able to finish 28 books in 9 months. It took me very little time to finish these book series. Other books (mostly non-fiction) took me ages to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not sure if I am getting any value out of non-fiction books \u003cem\u003eright now\u003c/em\u003e. I do not take notes and forget most of the lessons in a few days. Not sure if this is the right strategy while reading such books. Hence I have decided that I will reduce the number of non-fiction books \u003cem\u003efor some time\u003c/em\u003e and put more attention to technical publications and CS books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I am confident that my note-taking skills will not help in reading technical books either, I do hope to improve over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my reading goals from last year was to read a research paper every 15 days. I succeeded in the first quarter of the year and failed miserably after that. I started with a good intention and kept reading for some months. Then self-doubts began popping out. \u003cem\u003eWhat value am I getting out of this?\u003c/em\u003e, was the question in my mind. I started this exercise because I have specific goals in my mind, and I wanted to improve myself academically. But when you are not able to answer such a question even to yourself, then something is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis failure has taught me some crucial lessons. I tend to start things without thinking about the end goal. It is the right approach when \u003cem\u003elearnings\u003c/em\u003e from the process is more important than the result. But I was not able to focus on either of them. I lost my focus when I realized this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have come to understand the value of proper note-taking. I have read so many good books, but I do not remember any lessons from these books, because -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI read passively and try to finish the book as quickly as possible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did not try to implement the lessons in my day to day life while reading.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost my interest in reading news and blog articles also. I lost my interest from social media and, in general, the Internet entirely. I preferred to sleep as much as possible. That has its side-effects. Read on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"blogging-and-writing\"\u003eBlogging and Writing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had decided to write regularly in 2019. I didn\u0026rsquo;t. It seems that failing was a norm for me in 2019. This section was my worst hit interest in 2019. Somehow, I was not able to gather the concentration required for writing. I used to get sudden motivations for a few days, I wrote during those periods. The rest of the time, I just thought that I should write. I think I suffered from the so-called \u003cem\u003eWriter\u0026rsquo;s Block\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"health\"\u003eHealth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy analysis says that all my failures last year can be traced to this section. I was sick for almost a quarter of the year. Repeatedly getting ill and the time required for recovery took a toll on my body and mind. I lost all my focus and will power to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exercise was again an issue. I certainly put more effort than last year, but that effort was scattered throughout the year, for small periods. So, I do not notice much difference. However, I continued to walk whenever I got time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"work\"\u003eWork\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a very exciting year on the work front. I continued to work in Cisco this year. The work was neither very interesting nor very dull. The nature of my job is such that the exciting work shows up from time to time. With no fixed deadlines and no fixed way of doing things, it can be quite satisfying and quite frustrating at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"social-media\"\u003eSocial Media\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost my interest in social media altogether. I opened Facebook only to see the notification once in a while, sometimes after months. I got disillusioned by Twitter this year, because of the toxic political content there. I was never a regular user of YouTube anyway, so that was never a concern. However, I went to great lengths to delete every Google app from my phone, especially Gmail and YouTube. The email had become a new Facebook for me. I was checking emails every 15 minutes. So I signed out of Google account in my primary browser and restricted my email activities to a secondary browser. It helped me in keeping the urge to check email in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this sudden disinterest has created a void in my typical day, which is quite reasonable given how much my life depends on the Internet. I am yet to figure out how to fill this void. Reading books did not help, however sleeping and watching movies helped for sure (however, not without its own set of problems).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"travel\"\u003eTravel\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was somewhat dissatisfied with myself for not traveling enough. This year, I had decided to travel extensively. But my health betrayed me. Out of 365 days, I was able to take the time of 4 days for travel. I went to Coorg and Chikmagalur with friends. Both trips happened during the wrong weather conditions. But the circumstances were such that I could not deny to my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"miscellaneous\"\u003eMiscellaneous\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy daily routine, more or less, remained the same. Though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wake up early in the morning most of the time, the reality is that I was not trying. My only intention behind waking up early in the morning was to meditate. I did that, however sporadically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne other goal in 2019 was to get rid of procrastination. I did not care about it at all. Somehow, I was too busy fixing other issues in my life, that this seemed like a minor problem. Anyway, I did not attempt to do anything on a personal level, where procrastination would affect me.

I am not in a state to invest my mental strength fixing such issues right now. I will probably revisit this post sometime later to fix any problem.  It has been three months since 2020 started. I was not able to keep up with my yearly habit of posting year reviews due to some reasons. One primary reason behind my negligence is my disinterest in writing on this blog. I felt that it was because the old layout of this blog had been too recurrent for me. So, I decided to fix that issue before thinking about writing.\nThe year 2019 was not a great year for me on many fronts. It was a year that reminded me of my limitations and brought me out of the bubble, that self-help books created for me. In retrospection, I find that I started a lot of things, with the intention of learning, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t achieve any of the targets.\nLike, I structure these posts every year, I have divided this post too in many sections. It makes it easier for me to focus on various aspects of my life in the past year. I will start with the best parts of my life.\nReading I had decided to read 26 books in the year. I finished the year with 28 books. Out of 12 months, I did not read any book in January, November, and December. I finished two of the fiction series that I wanted to read for years - Harry Potter, and Percy Jackson. These two books are the reasons that I was able to finish 28 books in 9 months. It took me very little time to finish these book series. Other books (mostly non-fiction) took me ages to complete.\nI am not sure if I am getting any value out of non-fiction books right now. I do not take notes and forget most of the lessons in a few days. Not sure if this is the right strategy while reading such books. Hence I have decided that I will reduce the number of non-fiction books for some time and put more attention to technical publications and CS books.\nThough I am confident that my note-taking skills will not help in reading technical books either, I do hope to improve over time.\nOne of my reading goals from last year was to read a research paper every 15 days. I succeeded in the first quarter of the year and failed miserably after that. I started with a good intention and kept reading for some months. Then self-doubts began popping out. What value am I getting out of this?, was the question in my mind. I started this exercise because I have specific goals in my mind, and I wanted to improve myself academically. But when you are not able to answer such a question even to yourself, then something is wrong.\nThis failure has taught me some crucial lessons. I tend to start things without thinking about the end goal. It is the right approach when learnings from the process is more important than the result. But I was not able to focus on either of them. I lost my focus when I realized this.\nI have come to understand the value of proper note-taking. I have read so many good books, but I do not remember any lessons from these books, because -\n I read passively and try to finish the book as quickly as possible. I did not try to implement the lessons in my day to day life while reading.  I lost my interest in reading news and blog articles also. I lost my interest from social media and, in general, the Internet entirely. I preferred to sleep as much as possible. That has its side-effects. Read on.\nBlogging and Writing I had decided to write regularly in 2019. I didn\u0026rsquo;t. It seems that failing was a norm for me in 2019. This section was my worst hit interest in 2019. Somehow, I was not able to gather the concentration required for writing. I used to get sudden motivations for a few days, I wrote during those periods. The rest of the time, I just thought that I should write. I think I suffered from the so-called Writer\u0026rsquo;s Block.\nHealth My analysis says that all my failures last year can be traced to this section. I was sick for almost a quarter of the year. Repeatedly getting ill and the time required for recovery took a toll on my body and mind. I lost all my focus and will power to do anything.\nThe exercise was again an issue. I certainly put more effort than last year, but that effort was scattered throughout the year, for small periods. So, I do not notice much difference. However, I continued to walk whenever I got time.\nWork It was not a very exciting year on the work front. I continued to work in Cisco this year. The work was neither very interesting nor very dull. The nature of my job is such that the exciting work shows up from time to time. With no fixed deadlines and no fixed way of doing things, it can be quite satisfying and quite frustrating at times.\nSocial Media I lost my interest in social media altogether. I opened Facebook only to see the notification once in a while, sometimes after months. I got disillusioned by Twitter this year, because of the toxic political content there. I was never a regular user of YouTube anyway, so that was never a concern. However, I went to great lengths to delete every Google app from my phone, especially Gmail and YouTube. The email had become a new Facebook for me. I was checking emails every 15 minutes. So I signed out of Google account in my primary browser and restricted my email activities to a secondary browser. It helped me in keeping the urge to check email in control.\nBut this sudden disinterest has created a void in my typical day, which is quite reasonable given how much my life depends on the Internet. I am yet to figure out how to fill this void. Reading books did not help, however sleeping and watching movies helped for sure (however, not without its own set of problems).\nTravel I was somewhat dissatisfied with myself for not traveling enough. This year, I had decided to travel extensively. But my health betrayed me. Out of 365 days, I was able to take the time of 4 days for travel. I went to Coorg and Chikmagalur with friends. Both trips happened during the wrong weather conditions. But the circumstances were such that I could not deny to my friends.\nMiscellaneous My daily routine, more or less, remained the same. Though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wake up early in the morning most of the time, the reality is that I was not trying. My only intention behind waking up early in the morning was to meditate. I did that, however sporadically.\nOne other goal in 2019 was to get rid of procrastination. I did not care about it at all. Somehow, I was too busy fixing other issues in my life, that this seemed like a minor problem. Anyway, I did not attempt to do anything on a personal level, where procrastination would affect me. On the work front, at one point or another, you have to work and show results. So there it was never apparent. I tried many things to reduce the impact and influence of technology in my life. Although I consider myself successful to an extent, there is still scope for improvement.\nIn 2018, I was in full praise for to-do lists and the concept of maintaining goals. 2019 has busted all those praises. This year, these techniques did not work for me at all. Anyway, 2019 was one of those times when nothing worked for me, so this failure does not come as a surprise to me. Though, I still believe that this is something that can genuinely help me with some of my issues.\n If I had written this post at the beginning of the year 2020, I would have written some wish for the year 2020 at this place, as I always do, but this time is so gloomy that I am not able to think of anything good. I just pray to God that everything gets all right soon.\nBeing with family during this time, has given me some mental stability. But, it is also true that facing such circumstances and coming out triumphant, is what shows the human character.\n"},"name":"2019 - Year in Review","published":"2020-03-31T11:39:47+05:30","summary":"If you find any grammatical errors in this post, please excuse me.

Cheers 😄\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"Before I start, here is some technical information about my website -\n Hosted on Gitlab and usage its CD for automatic deployment, which is triggered on a git commit. The domain name registrar is GoDaddy. Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt as the TLS certificate provider for my domain name.  Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt provides certificates for 90 days only, so I was forced to set up the certbot every three months, then generate the certificate and manually deploy the certificates to GitLab. It was frustrating because in three months, my shell probably will not remember the command I used last time, and I was too lazy to document the process somewhere.\nThen I came across a project, which was trying to do a similar thing with other domain name registrar. I thought that this is an excellent setup to adapt and modify it to suit my needs. So I decided to write my module for automatic deployment of Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificates to GitLab.\nHow does Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt work? Before Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt can generate the certificate for the domain, it requires the user to prove domain ownership. Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt provides two methods to do this task -\n Updating the DNS records of the domain registrar (DNS-01 challenge) Adding an HTTP resource under a well-known URI on the website (HTTP-01 challenge)  Using the second method requires me to add a file on my website, and I did not want to do that. Moreover, if in the future, I decide to host some other service, which does not have a website, then this method will fail.\nThe first method requires that the domain configuration on the domain registrar is modified. GoDaddy provides a robust API, and it is not difficult to utilize that API to automate specific tasks. The probability of changing the registrar is quite low, at least for the next few years. It will be easier to generate the certificates for any subdomains, as all the subdomains will also be hosted under the same domain registrar.\nHow does the tool work? So here are the steps:\n Call certbot with all the domain names Invoke GoDaddy API to update the DNS records as indicated by Certbot Wait for 10 minutes for DNS changes to propagate Let certbot verify the DNS changes Use the GitLab API to deploy the generated certificates to GitLab pages  Step 1: Invoking certbot In step 1, we call certbot will the preferred method DNS. We also need to supply an email id (used by Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to notify domain expiration). The EMAIL_ID environment variable can be used to store the email id of the user.\nCertbot runs in an interactive mode by default. It is not desired in a scripted environment. Certbot also provides mechanisms to deploy the certificates to a local server automatically, but as we are hosting our website on Gitlab, we do not want the automatic deployment facility. So we need to invoke the certbot command with --manual and certonly modes.\ncertbot --manual \\  --preferred-challenges dns \\  --agree-tos \\  --email \u0026#34;${EMAIL_ID}\u0026#34; \\  --no-eff-email \\  --expand \\  --renew-by-default \\  --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \\  --noninteractive \\  --redirect \\  --config-dir ${DIR}/generated/config \\  --work-dir ${DIR}/generated/work \\  --logs-dir ${DIR}/generated/logs \\  --manual-auth-hook ${DIR}/auth_hook.sh \\  -d yashagarwal.in \\  certonly The explanation for most of the flags used in the above command can be found by running the following command -\ncertbot --help The --manual-auth-hook flag is worth looking. This hook provides a mechanism to specify the executable, which can be used to facilitate domain ownership validation. In this case, the hook points to a script auth_hook.sh, which then calls a Go client, which interacts with GoDaddy API.\nStep 2: Adding DNS entry to GoDaddy DNS manager Certbot supplies two environment variables CERTBOT_DOMAIN, which contains the domain name to be verified and CERTBOT_VALIDATION, which includes a random string corresponding to _acme-challenge TXT entry. What this means is that, if I have\nCERTBOT_DOMAIN=yashagarwal.in CERTBOT_VALIDATION=6VNg5kDVI_BF1S9N5s74LTBHQnwDpQqKlblKRjIzBwM Then the DNS manager should contain a TXT entry _acme-challenge.yashagarwal.in with the value of 6VNg5kDVI_BF1S9N5s74LTBHQnwDpQqKlblKRjIzBwM.\nThe auth_hook.sh file calls the Go client with the abovementioned environment variables. The relevant code can be found here.\nOnce all the DNS entries are added, the auth_hook.sh script will sleep for 10 minutes. It is to allow DNS changes to propagate throughout the Internet. It is a random duration as I could not find any GoDaddy support page mentioning the exact period used by them.\nStep 3: Generation of certificates Once the auth_hook.sh script returns successfully, certbot will verify the DNS records. If the verification is successful, certbot will generate the certificates in ./generated/config/live/{CERTBOT_DOMAIN} directory.\nStep 4: Deploying the certificates to GitLab I use the following command to deploy the certificates to Gitlab pages where my website is hosted -\ncurl -vvv \\  --request PUT \\  --header \u0026#34;Private-Token:${GITLAB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; \\  --form \u0026#34;certificate=@${key_dir}/fullchain.pem\u0026#34; \\  --form \u0026#34;key=@${key_dir}/privkey.pem\u0026#34; \\ \u0026#34;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/yashhere%2Fyashhere.gitlab.io/pages/domains/yashagarwal.in\u0026#34; where\nkey_dir=\u0026#34;./generated/config/live/yashagarwal.in\u0026#34; Moreover, GITLAB_TOKEN is an environment variable that contains the API token generated from the Gitlab settings page.\nAutomatic Deployment using Travis CI It is not automation if I have to run this script manually every three months. So I created a Travis CI job to automate this process. The job will run every month and deploy my certificates automatically. It has been four months, and I have not faced any issues with this setup.\nThe code for this post can be viewed at Github.\nThanks for reading.

ModSecurity is one of them. It is the most famous and useful open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) in existence. It is supported by various web servers such as Apache, Nginx, and IIS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job of ModSecurity is to sit in front of the application web server and check the incoming requests and outgoing responses to filter out malicious content. It does so by the use of powerful and complex regular expressions. ModSecurity uses a rule language for its rules. The rule language has variables and operators defined to aid in the process of parsing HTTP requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModSecurity, in itself, cannot block or allow requests. It is just a rule engine. It requires rules to operate appropriately. That\u0026rsquo;s where its sister project, Core Rule Set (CRS), comes into the picture. CRS is a rule set developed to be used with ModSecurity. It has been in active development for several years now and is very mature. Together, ModSecurity and CRS form a formidable defense against the widespread web application attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you know, what a WAF is, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed to install ModSecurity on Ubuntu.

ModSecurity is one of them. It is the most famous and useful open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) in existence. It is supported by various web servers such as Apache, Nginx, and IIS.\nThe job of ModSecurity is to sit in front of the application web server and check the incoming requests and outgoing responses to filter out malicious content. It does so by the use of powerful and complex regular expressions. ModSecurity uses a rule language for its rules. The rule language has variables and operators defined to aid in the process of parsing HTTP requests.\nModSecurity, in itself, cannot block or allow requests. It is just a rule engine. It requires rules to operate appropriately. That\u0026rsquo;s where its sister project, Core Rule Set (CRS), comes into the picture. CRS is a rule set developed to be used with ModSecurity. It has been in active development for several years now and is very mature. Together, ModSecurity and CRS form a formidable defense against the widespread web application attacks.\nNow that you know, what a WAF is, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed to install ModSecurity on Ubuntu.

If anyone has managed to make it work consistently, please let me know.\nAnyway, if you are like me, who do not like the default ModSecurity log format, ModSecurity provides an option to generate logs in JSON format as well. To enable JSON support, the YAJL library should be installed. We already installed this package when we were installing dependencies, so our ModSecurity setup is compiled with JSON support. Let us now configure ModSecurity to generate JSON logs.\nOpen the /etc/apache2/modsec/modsecurity.conf file and find the following lines -\nSecAuditLogType Serial SecAuditLog /var/log/modsec_audit.log Once you have found the following lines, replace these lines with the following lines\nSecAuditLogFormat JSON SecAuditLogType Parallel SecAuditLog /var/log/apache2/modsec_audit.log SecAuditLogStorageDir /var/log/apache2/audit/ SecAuditLogFileMode 0644 SecAuditLogDirMode 0755 Restart Apache server\nsudo systemctl restart apache2 Now, go to /var/log/apache2/ directory and create audit folder.\ncd /var/log/apache2 sudo mkdir audit # make `apache_user` owner of this directory as well... sudo chown -R $apache_user:$apache_user /var/log/apache2/audit Now, ModSecurity should be able to generate JSON logs in this directory.

They had promised a Mahindra KUV100, but at the last moment, that couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep their commitment and gave us a Honda Amaze with automatic transmission.

Although the rainy season might not be the best time to travel, there is a certain charm in holidaying during the downpour.\nWe (I and my flatmates in Bengaluru) were planning a trip to Chikmagalur since the beginning of June. One of my friends knows driving, so we decided to rent a car and drive ourselves to a distance of approximately 250 KMs. We booked the car through Drivezy. They had promised a Mahindra KUV100, but at the last moment, that couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep their commitment and gave us a Honda Amaze with automatic transmission. My friend who was driving had never driven such a car, so we all got scared of our fate for the next two days, but we decided to go ahead with it, trusting our friend.\nI too know driving, but like every other aspect of my life, I never gained enough confidence to go on such a long drive. It was a similar case this time as well.\nThe way to Chikmagalur from Bengaluru is the well-maintained NH75 (it has a total of four tolls, so maintenance is expected). We started early on the morning of Saturday, 22nd June to avoid Bengaluru\u0026rsquo;s traffic. Nature was accommodating that day, and the Sun 🌞 stayed hidden behind clouds for most of our journey. That made our 6-hour drive very enjoyable.\n   Somewhere on NH75\n   We were not in any hurry and wanted to enjoy every moment of our trip to the fullest. With Punjabi beats playing in our car, we stopped at various places on the highway.\n Chikmagalur means \u0026ldquo;The town of the younger daughter\u0026rdquo; in the Kannada. The town is said to have been given as a dowry to the younger daughter of Rukmangada, the legendary chief of Sakkarepatna and hence the name.\n\u0026mdash; Wikipedia\n We stopped at Adyar Ananda Bhavan 🏨 for breakfast. I have tasted sweets from A2B, and the taste was the best that I could get in the South. So I decided to eat Masala Dosai and Idli Sambhar there. The food did not disappoint me at all.\nAfter breakfast, we resumed our journey. The first stop in our trip was the gorgeous Sri Chennakeshava Temple. Chenna means beautiful and Keshava refers to Lord Vishnu. That should give you an idea, the presiding deity of the temple is the Handsome Vishnu.\nThe whole premises of the temple is filled with sheer poetry on the walls in the form of stone sculptures. I was completely mesmerized by its intricate but aesthetically pleasing carvings.\nOn the entrance of the temple, a vast golden Gopuram welcomes the devotees. I was amazed by the level of details on the sculptures engraved on the Gopuram. My phone\u0026rsquo;s camera will not be able to do justice to this intricate artistry.\n   The Gopuram of Sri Chennakeshava Temple\n   The one specialty of the main temple is that it does not feature a dome. I have not seen any major Hindu temple without a dome over the idol of the main deity. It seems like an aberration to me, but a welcoming one. A disclaimer, I am not an architecture buff, so I do not know how correct my facts are here.\n   Sri Chennakeshava Temple, from outside\n   The inside of the temple is pretty dark. There are several pillars inside the temple. Each of the pillars is decorated with various types of sculptors.\n   A pillar inside the temple\n   However, the fascinating thing is at the ceiling. The carvings done on the ceiling of the temple is just amazing.\n   The ceiling of the temple\n    If you zoom in a little bit, you will see a depiction of Narasimha avatar of Lord Vishnu in the center of the ceiling.\n As I mentioned above, I am not an architecture buff, so I would not be able to write a lot about the architecture of the temple. However, enjoy some more photos.\n                                             After this temple, we continued our journey to Chikmagalur. We had booked a homestay option. The name of the homestay was Sunshine Palm Retreat, if I recall correctly. It was one of the best stays I have experienced on any trip till now. It was not crowded, the staff was co-operative, and the ambiance was excellent.\n   The Silver Palm Retreat Homestay\n   On the evening of Saturday, we decided to go for our second destination of the day - the so-called shooting point. When we searched on Google maps, we found one location with a similar name. We started driving in that direction. However, it turned out that we were going to the wrong place. We tried asking locals, but language was an issue. Most of the signboards are also in Kannada only. Somehow we ended up getting on the right track and reached the correct location on time. After reaching there, Google Maps shows that the place is called Bagmane Sunrise Point. Even this name does not seem to be right.\nAs soon we reached there, I realized that all the efforts that we put in reaching there were worthwhile. It was an open ground area on top of a small hill at one end of a small village. I started roaming here and there, enjoying the serenity of nature. I am not a very photogenic person, so I prefer to click pictures of objects and nature more than standing in front of a camera at different angles.\n             We spent around 1.5 hours there and then came back. India vs. Afghanistan cricket match was live on TV, and we fixed ourselves in front of the TV for the next 4 hours. India somehow won that match. Thank God!\nThe next day, it was raining from the early morning. We did not want to take any risk by driving on the steep and narrow zig-zag roads. So we dropped our plan to go to Butter Milk Waterfalls and instead decided to go to Mullayanagiri peaks as our last destination. We again lost our way, but somehow managed to reach the place.\nIt was drizzling there. However, we were at such a high altitude that we had to bring our sweaters out. Surprisingly, I found vendors selling Maggi there. I was not expecting the taste to be good, but I was wrong. For that sort of place, the Maggi was delicious.\n  Despite the weather conditions, we decided to climb to the top of the hill. As we were going up, the weather was turning more and bleaker. Out of five of us, only three managed to reach the top, including me. The view from the top of the hill was just amazing. Wherever I saw, I saw just the mountain mist. My clothes were wet, and my spectacles were completely covered in fog.\n             I shot a video when we were coming down from the hilltop.\n   To summarise, the timing of this trip was not appropriate, but I do not regret it. I have gone to other hill stations after the monsoons get over, but it is a different experience altogether to go in a rainy season. Chikmagalur is worth more than one visit. Do try to go at an appropriate time if you want to visit more places.\nThanks for reading.

Here we are hardcoding this data, as I did\nnot want to waste my time in implementing a user registration service, but this functionality is not very important from\nour point of view. We will require only one field from this users data - the \u003ccode\u003euser_type\u003c/code\u003e field. This field will\ndetermine what the access level for the user is. We have already added the \u003ccode\u003eaccess_level\u003c/code\u003e field in the \u003ccode\u003eBook\u003c/code\u003e definition\nof our proto file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the user wants to search for a particular book, it will provide its \u003ccode\u003euser_type\u003c/code\u003e the ISBN of the book to our service.

We will solve this problem using OPA in the next and last post of this series.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s solve this issue now. We will use OPA\u0026rsquo;s declarative language, Rego, to implement policies which will decide on the basis of some user-provided data, which all objects are to be returned to the user.\nWe will also define a list of all the users who are part of this library. Here we are hardcoding this data, as I did not want to waste my time in implementing a user registration service, but this functionality is not very important from our point of view. We will require only one field from this users data - the user_type field. This field will determine what the access level for the user is. We have already added the access_level field in the Book definition of our proto file.\nWhen the user wants to search for a particular book, it will provide its user_type the ISBN of the book to our service. Our service will take that ISBN and pass it to the OPA server. OPA server already has the Book data and the User data. Now it has the required ISBN to query the Book data. The Rego policy will query the Book data by ISBN. It will also check for the access_level condition. Moreover, after this operation, it will return the resultant set of books that satisfy both the requirements.\nHere is the Rego policy -\npackage library import data.books import data.users import input search_books[book] { input.book.isbn == books[i].isbn input.user.user_type \u0026gt;= books[i].access_level book = books[i] } list_all_books[books[i]] { input.user.user_type \u0026gt;= books[i].access_level } The user data is here and the book data is here.\nA sample input request is shown below -\n{ \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;book\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;isbn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1128959038\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user_type\u0026#34;: 3 } } } The input is the data that the user is providing. In search_books function, the input ISBN is matched with the ISBN of all books one by one. Then the resultant set of books is filtered by user_type and access_level (these two fields are essentially the same). In the last, the resultant set of books is assigned to the variable book which will be returned to the gRPC service.\nThe list_all_books function is implemented similarly. The only difference is that we do not need to filter the books by ISBN. Filtering by access_level is enough.\nNow our library service is completed. It is a very basic service. The intention was to show that the decision-making process can be offloaded to the OPA to reduce the complexity of the services. In this example, the advantages might not be obvious, but in large production environments, where many services are running, it can make a significant difference.\nThe code for this series can be found on my Github account.\nI hope you liked the article.

In this post, we will define the data definitions using protobuf, and then we will use these definitions to create a Go service. We will also add a REST interface to the service. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nDefining Proto Definitions gRPC uses protocol buffers for serializing structured data. To define the structure of the data that you want to serialize, we use a proto file - it is a simple text file that contains all the logical pieces of your data in the form of messages, and the methods that will be called over the network. To know more about the syntax of proto files, visit this link.\nI have defined the following proto file -\nsyntax = \u0026#34;proto3\u0026#34;;package library;import \u0026#34;google/api/annotations.proto\u0026#34;;service LibraryService { rpc ListAllBooks(QueryFormat) returns (Books) { option (google.api.http) = { post : \u0026#34;/listBooks\u0026#34; body : \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; }; rpc AddBook(QueryFormat) returns (Response) { option (google.api.http) = { post : \u0026#34;/addBook\u0026#34; body : \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; }; rpc SearchBook(QueryFormat) returns (Response) { option (google.api.http) = { post : \u0026#34;/searchBook\u0026#34; body : \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }; };}// the library message Library { Books books = 1; }message Books { repeated Book books = 1; }// metadata about a book message Book { string title = 1; string author = 2; string isbn = 3; int32 no_of_copies = 5; int32 access_level = 6;}// details about a user message User { enum UserType { // https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/258  GARBAGE = 0; Student = 1; Administration = 2; Faculty = 3; } string name = 1; int32 id_no = 2; UserType user_type = 4;}message QueryFormat { Book book = 1; User user = 2;}message Response { string action = 1; int32 status = 2; string message = 3; oneof value { Book book = 4; User user_data = 5; }}message Empty {} To compile it, run the following commands -\nprotoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \\ -I$GOPATH/src \\ -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \\ --go_out=plugins=grpc:. \\ api/library.proto protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \\  -I$GOPATH/src \\  -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \\  --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true:. \\  api/library.proto It will generate corresponding Golang definitions of the messages and services defined in the Proto file.

On the work front, I got a chance to work on Go, gRPC, and Open\nPolicy Agent as my first professional project. In this post, I will be demonstrating what I learned in the last few months.\nWe will be implementing a simple gRPC based library service, which will be able to serve\nrequests using both gRPC and REST calls. It will also incorporate the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to provide the authorization\nto users. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with a quick introduction to gRPC and OPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"grpc\"\u003egRPC\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egRPC is Google\u0026rsquo;s implementation for Remote Procedure Calls(RPC). RPC is mainly used in building scalable distributed systems. While REST has a limited set of verbs, RPC can define any function calls, including synchronous and asynchronous calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn gRPC, the client can make procedure calls as if the requests are made to some local function. However, the underlying client\nstub (auto-generated) will send the call to the server. The server will have a similar server stub, which will be able to\nhandle the requests coming from the client. The server will send the response to the client using similar mechanisms\nover the network. All the communication is serialized to binary format, so it is ideal for distributed systems as binary format\ntends to be on the faster side for large amounts of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more info about gRPC, visit the official \u003ca href=\"https://grpc.io/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-policy-agent-opa\"\u003eOpen Policy Agent (OPA)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOPA gives us the ability to define a fine-grained policy control mechanism. However, I think the most critical benefit of\nusing OPA is that it gives you the ability to decouple your services and the definition of policies from the enforcement\nof it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are mainly two parts of OPA -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA JSON document store where you can define anything from your users, access roles,\npermission levels, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA policy is written in a declarative language. This policy gives you new derivative data from the original JSON document store evaluated by the policy. The declarative language is called Rego, and these policies are also documents that generate results according to the defined policy. The users query these results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis info will be sufficient for our use case. More info about it can be found at the official\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openpolicyagent.org/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-skeleton-of-our-application\"\u003eThe skeleton of our Application\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will be building a command-line library application. This application will support adding, deleting, searching, issuing, and returning of\nbooks. There are three types of users \u0026ndash; student, faculties, and staff. Not all users have a similar kind of access level. There are some books which are only reserved for students, and some are exclusively reserved for faculties and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think emulating the \u003ca href=\"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Library\"\u003elibrary\u003c/a\u003e at Hogwarts will be a good idea here. Students and ordinary people were not allowed inside\nthe restricted section of the library. We will emulate that restricted section using the authorization mechanisms\nprovided by OPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gRPC protocol will handle the communications part in our app, but not everyone in Hogwarts is using gRPC. Wizards\nare still in love with REST (not a bad thing, though), so we will provide them alike the REST interface to interact\nwith our service. We do not want to face the wrath of the wizards, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOPA can either be used as a standalone application or be embedded in the Go service as well. Both approaches have\ntheir pros and cons. I have decided to use OPA as an independent service, as it will be more comfortable that way for us to push\nauthorization data and policies to it if such a need arises in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more issue remains - where to store the added books. Shall we persist them? In practical scenarios, persistence is\nalways a good idea, but here I do not want to complicate things too much. We could use any Object storage servers (e.g., Minio) to\nstore the JSON data generated from our gRPC methods, but that will unnecessarily add complexity to our simple scenario.\nWizards do not like complicate stuff, you know!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next posts, we will define our gRPC proto file and build the Go service around it. Then we will add a REST\ninterface to our service for simple CRUD operations in our application.

It will also incorporate the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to provide the authorization to users. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with a quick introduction to gRPC and OPA.\ngRPC gRPC is Google\u0026rsquo;s implementation for Remote Procedure Calls(RPC). RPC is mainly used in building scalable distributed systems. While REST has a limited set of verbs, RPC can define any function calls, including synchronous and asynchronous calls.\nIn gRPC, the client can make procedure calls as if the requests are made to some local function. However, the underlying client stub (auto-generated) will send the call to the server. The server will have a similar server stub, which will be able to handle the requests coming from the client. The server will send the response to the client using similar mechanisms over the network. All the communication is serialized to binary format, so it is ideal for distributed systems as binary format tends to be on the faster side for large amounts of data.\nFor more info about gRPC, visit the official website.\nOpen Policy Agent (OPA) OPA gives us the ability to define a fine-grained policy control mechanism. However, I think the most critical benefit of using OPA is that it gives you the ability to decouple your services and the definition of policies from the enforcement of it.\nThere are mainly two parts of OPA -\n A JSON document store where you can define anything from your users, access roles, permission levels, etc. A policy is written in a declarative language. This policy gives you new derivative data from the original JSON document store evaluated by the policy. The declarative language is called Rego, and these policies are also documents that generate results according to the defined policy. The users query these results.  This info will be sufficient for our use case. More info about it can be found at the official website.\nThe skeleton of our Application We will be building a command-line library application. This application will support adding, deleting, searching, issuing, and returning of books. There are three types of users \u0026ndash; student, faculties, and staff. Not all users have a similar kind of access level. There are some books which are only reserved for students, and some are exclusively reserved for faculties and so on.\nI think emulating the library at Hogwarts will be a good idea here. Students and ordinary people were not allowed inside the restricted section of the library. We will emulate that restricted section using the authorization mechanisms provided by OPA.\nThe gRPC protocol will handle the communications part in our app, but not everyone in Hogwarts is using gRPC. Wizards are still in love with REST (not a bad thing, though), so we will provide them alike the REST interface to interact with our service. We do not want to face the wrath of the wizards, after all.\nOPA can either be used as a standalone application or be embedded in the Go service as well. Both approaches have their pros and cons. I have decided to use OPA as an independent service, as it will be more comfortable that way for us to push authorization data and policies to it if such a need arises in the future.\nOne more issue remains - where to store the added books. Shall we persist them? In practical scenarios, persistence is always a good idea, but here I do not want to complicate things too much. We could use any Object storage servers (e.g., Minio) to store the JSON data generated from our gRPC methods, but that will unnecessarily add complexity to our simple scenario. Wizards do not like complicate stuff, you know!\nIn the next posts, we will define our gRPC proto file and build the Go service around it. Then we will add a REST interface to our service for simple CRUD operations in our application. Then we will add OPA authorization to restrict our users from adding and viewing books which they are not supposed to access.\nThank you for reading. Cheers 😊\n"},"name":"Go + gRPC + OPA - A Perfect Union - Part 1","published":"2019-02-10T14:29:08+05:30","summary":"TL;DR \u0026ndash; In a series of blog posts, I will be implementing a simple library application supporting both gRPC and REST interfaces using Go, gRPC, and OPA.

It was the year when I had to come out of the comfort zone of my\nparents\u0026rsquo; protection. My professional life began this year, and I started earning MONEY.

I learned many life lessons, kept myself in\ncheck, built some useful contacts, learned a lot about many CS-related things, and ended up with a decent job in the\nend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I sense that this is not the happy ending of my journey towards learning, and I have a lot more to learn. I\nrecently read the book \u0026ldquo;The Alchemist,\u0026rdquo; and the central theme of this book is to keep looking for your legend. I am\nstill searching for my legend. In 2019, I expect to find new ways to keep learning and explore new areas both in CS and other fields of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"relationships\"\u003eRelationships\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore this year, I had an assumption that I lack social skills. I hesitated in talking to people. I decided to change\nit this year. I was waiting for a change in my life, probably because NITC had become too monotonous for me. It was one of my\nnew year\u0026rsquo;s resolution that I will change myself and become more approachable to people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not know if I have changed or not, but I feel much more confident now than ever in communicating with people.

This year, I finally managed to control my addiction. For a\ngood part of the year, either my Facebook account remained deactivated, or I was logged out of it. In the past, I used to feel a\nstrong urge to open Facebook every ten minutes, but this year, I was able to keep this urge in control. When my account was not\ndeactivated, I kept myself so busy in other works, that I did not even think of Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the good thing is that I\ndid not notice any symptoms of withdrawal symptoms because of this sudden quitting of Facebook. A friend\u0026rsquo;s advice worked\nnicely. It was quite tricky, indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was never addicted to any other social media platform, but I decided that I can use Twitter for my benefit. I feel\nTwitter is a useful tool if utilized correctly. I followed many people who tweet regularly about CS related stuff. I open\nTwitter once every 2-3 days for a very short duration to collect some articles and tips. Nowadays, these articles, along with a few blog articles from Feedly, mainly form my Instapaper feed. Though Instapaper recently switched to\ncommercial model again, I decided to keep using it for the time being until I find some other alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"miscellaneous\"\u003eMiscellaneous\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had decided to exercise for at least 90% part of 2018. I failed miserably. Leave alone every day; I could not even do it\ncontinuously for one month. I need to make this a top priority. Otherwise, it is going to create trouble for me soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last two years, I am trying to get up early in the morning every day. My body does not seem to care, though. It seems a classic\nexample of the struggle between mind and body. My brain says that I am an early bird, but my body straightforwardly rejects\nthis idea. I have felt the positives of waking up early, so I am still trying my best so that my body can\nadjust to this change. I will keep working on this habit in 2019 as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed a bad habit in myself - procrastination. I procrastinated a lot in 2018. Things that I could have finished well\nwithin the deadlines took me ages to complete. I was always late in my BTech project deadlines, I could not finish one of my\nhobby projects, I could not finish my study targets on time, and many other such examples haunted me this year. It is one\nof my most important goals of 2019 that I need a way to find how to concentrate on one thing at a time. Many things distract me while I am working. Technology itself is a significant distraction, but because I am a CS\nprofessional, this is one thing from which I cannot run away. However, I will still try to avoid getting distracted\nby my \u003cem\u003ecuriosity\u003c/em\u003e and put more focus on doing work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am writing more than ever. However, with my increased writing, my English vocabulary is not enough anymore. This year, it\nhappened many times that I wanted to write something, but because of the lack of proper words in my vocabulary, I had to\nsettle with \u003cem\u003einferior\u003c/em\u003e words. I tried multiple times this year to work on improving my vocabulary, but I failed badly.\nI will increase my focus on improving my knowledge of English in 2019 so that such small issues do not stop me from adding something to my skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, I experimented and tried to organize myself with to-do lists. It was a fruitful exercise, and it had a lot of sound effects on my productivity. The days when I made a to-do list, I felt very energetic and encouraged to\nfinish all the tasks on my list. However, then I noticed one thing, I could not continue doing this for more than a few days at\nonce. For initial days, I felt encouraged to complete my tasks, but soon it began to appear as a\nburden, and I felt exhausted. So it seems that something in the middle will work for me. This year, I will continue\nusing to-do lists (I use Google Keep for this) but for short durations of time. I will refrain from using it every day\nto avoid getting exhausted. I am considering a switch to \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e to maintain my monthly and long-term goals.\nProbably that will also help me in keeping track of my goals without feeling the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of my friends love to travel. It seems a common habit in most of my friends. However, I am an exception. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly eager to go on trips. I attribute it to my issues with motion sickness. For the whole year of 2018, I do not have a single\ntrip memory other than my travels to Bengaluru and Jaipur airports. Oh yeah, after thinking for some time, I recalled that I went on one trip\nfrom Bengaluru to Calicut to attend my convocation ceremony. That\u0026rsquo;s all! I will \u003cem\u003econsider\u003c/em\u003e accepting trip invitations\nfrom my friends in 2019. Up until now, I keep refusing to join them in their trips due to my health issues, my desire to\nstay in solitude and partially because of my unwillingness to explore anything outside technology. However, it is time I start changing\nmyself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a grave mistake that during my four-year stay in Kerala, I did not try to learn Malayalam. I feel that I\nmissed an excellent opportunity to learn a new language. Although I am as bad as other north Indians when it comes to\nknowing multiple languages (correct me if I am wrong, I do not intend to generalize all north Indians), I think that learning a new language can be very beneficial for \u003cem\u003esome parts of my brain\u003c/em\u003e. Now I am in Karnataka, yet\nanother south Indian state and with yet another language. It is an excellent opportunity, and I am not going to repeat\nmy mistake this time. Even if I do not succeed in learning Kannada, it will provide enough challenges to my brain for the short term.\nWho knows, it might also give me a new skill!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome 2019, I hope that you will help me in taking a step closer to discovering myself. Give me new experiences, keep me grounded and help me in\ncontributing to the progress of my India.\u003c/strong\u003e 😊\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"The year 2018 has been quite a roller coaster year for me. I saw many ups and downs, many successes, and many failures faced many challenges on the personal front and struggled to keep myself on track. I have been working hard on improving my lifestyle (not materialistically) for the last few years, and the benefits have begun to show up now. This year was a pinnacle in that aspect. A lot of micro changes happened in my life this year.\nI often read my blog posts from last year. Reading these posts give me a good feeling about the improvements that I could bring in myself during the previous three years. Writing year reviews and posts like this, this and this serve as documents of my deeds from past for my future. It helps me in not repeating the same mistakes. As a human being, I cannot run away from committing mistakes, but I can always make sure that I do not repeat the same mistakes.\n Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n Blogging \u0026amp; Writing I had set a target to write 15 blog articles at the beginning of this year. In the end, I managed to achieve this goal. I managed to write 17 blog posts and six book reviews. My blog managed to get much traffic this year, mainly thanks to some of my technical posts.\nI got some good responses from people about my technical blog posts. My aim to start writing technical posts was to keep an account of what I learn. It feels very nice when I go back to my posts to read how I did something last time. So I consider myself successful that at least I could benefit from my writing.\nThough, in 2018, after leaving college, the frequency of technical posts on this blog has dipped to almost zero. It is probably because I am not exploring enough after joining the corporate world. In college, I used Linux all the time, but now it is nearly four months since I last booted Linux in my system. I think it is yet another phase of my learning, and I will take some time adjusting with this. I have some lovely technical post ideas, and I hope that I will be able to articulate them soon next year.\nReading For most of the year, I did not pay any heed to books, and I was never very interested in buying books. However, at the end of October, I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite. I consider this to be the best investment done by me this year. Since buying it, I have read eight books. I finally managed to finish my Goodreads reading challenge of 10 books. Although I could not finish one book and included one audiobook to this challenge to complete my target on time.\nThis year, I discovered my interest in Economics. I am reading some economics-related literature lately. It is a subtle shift from my all-CS life. I plan to read a lot of economics-related books in 2019 to gain more expertise in this domain. But I still need to figure out a way to stop it from interfering with my first (or second, maybe!) love.\nSome of my favorite reads from this year (not in any particular order) -\n  Technology / CS\n Branch Prediction The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine In defence of swap: common misconceptions A few things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about computer networking Using Go as a scripting language in Linux Maximize Cache Performance with this One Weird Trick: An Introduction to Cache-Oblivious Data Structures IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT The ``Clockwise/Spiral Rule\u0026rsquo;' A successful Git branching model So, should you do a CS degree?

It feels delightful when you see the money gets deposited to your bank account every month for the hard(!) work that you have done for the last one month. But\n With great power comes great responsibility.\n I believe that I have been able to control this feeling of power quite nicely until now. Probably being an Agarwal helped :P\nComing back to work, those who do not know, I joined Cisco Systems this year as a Software Engineer. The job is pretty good for my initial expectations. I made some good friends. First time in my life, I managed to make a group of friends.\nQuite an achievement.\nStudies This year was officially my last year in formal education. Although I failed to finish my bachelors with a satisfactory final GPA (at least I am not happy with it), I am very much satisfied with all my learnings from college. I learned many life lessons, kept myself in check, built some useful contacts, learned a lot about many CS-related things, and ended up with a decent job in the end.\nHowever, I sense that this is not the happy ending of my journey towards learning, and I have a lot more to learn. I recently read the book \u0026ldquo;The Alchemist,\u0026rdquo; and the central theme of this book is to keep looking for your legend. I am still searching for my legend. In 2019, I expect to find new ways to keep learning and explore new areas both in CS and other fields of life.\nRelationships Before this year, I had an assumption that I lack social skills. I hesitated in talking to people. I decided to change it this year. I was waiting for a change in my life, probably because NITC had become too monotonous for me. It was one of my new year\u0026rsquo;s resolution that I will change myself and become more approachable to people.\nI do not know if I have changed or not, but I feel much more confident now than ever in communicating with people. I hope I will continue to improve in 2019 as well.\nSocial Media I was trying to get rid of Facebook for quite some time. This year, I finally managed to control my addiction. For a good part of the year, either my Facebook account remained deactivated, or I was logged out of it. In the past, I used to feel a strong urge to open Facebook every ten minutes, but this year, I was able to keep this urge in control. When my account was not deactivated, I kept myself so busy in other works, that I did not even think of Facebook.\nMoreover, the good thing is that I did not notice any symptoms of withdrawal symptoms because of this sudden quitting of Facebook. A friend\u0026rsquo;s advice worked nicely. It was quite tricky, indeed.\nI was never addicted to any other social media platform, but I decided that I can use Twitter for my benefit. I feel Twitter is a useful tool if utilized correctly. I followed many people who tweet regularly about CS related stuff. I open Twitter once every 2-3 days for a very short duration to collect some articles and tips. Nowadays, these articles, along with a few blog articles from Feedly, mainly form my Instapaper feed. Though Instapaper recently switched to commercial model again, I decided to keep using it for the time being until I find some other alternative.\nMiscellaneous I had decided to exercise for at least 90% part of 2018. I failed miserably. Leave alone every day; I could not even do it continuously for one month. I need to make this a top priority. Otherwise, it is going to create trouble for me soon.\nFor the last two years, I am trying to get up early in the morning every day. My body does not seem to care, though. It seems a classic example of the struggle between mind and body. My brain says that I am an early bird, but my body straightforwardly rejects this idea. I have felt the positives of waking up early, so I am still trying my best so that my body can adjust to this change. I will keep working on this habit in 2019 as well.\nI noticed a bad habit in myself - procrastination. I procrastinated a lot in 2018. Things that I could have finished well within the deadlines took me ages to complete. I was always late in my BTech project deadlines, I could not finish one of my hobby projects, I could not finish my study targets on time, and many other such examples haunted me this year. It is one of my most important goals of 2019 that I need a way to find how to concentrate on one thing at a time. Many things distract me while I am working. Technology itself is a significant distraction, but because I am a CS professional, this is one thing from which I cannot run away. However, I will still try to avoid getting distracted by my curiosity and put more focus on doing work.\nI am writing more than ever. However, with my increased writing, my English vocabulary is not enough anymore. This year, it happened many times that I wanted to write something, but because of the lack of proper words in my vocabulary, I had to settle with inferior words. I tried multiple times this year to work on improving my vocabulary, but I failed badly. I will increase my focus on improving my knowledge of English in 2019 so that such small issues do not stop me from adding something to my skills.\nThis year, I experimented and tried to organize myself with to-do lists. It was a fruitful exercise, and it had a lot of sound effects on my productivity. The days when I made a to-do list, I felt very energetic and encouraged to finish all the tasks on my list. However, then I noticed one thing, I could not continue doing this for more than a few days at once. For initial days, I felt encouraged to complete my tasks, but soon it began to appear as a burden, and I felt exhausted. So it seems that something in the middle will work for me. This year, I will continue using to-do lists (I use Google Keep for this) but for short durations of time. I will refrain from using it every day to avoid getting exhausted. I am considering a switch to Notion to maintain my monthly and long-term goals. Probably that will also help me in keeping track of my goals without feeling the heat.\nAll of my friends love to travel. It seems a common habit in most of my friends. However, I am an exception. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly eager to go on trips. I attribute it to my issues with motion sickness. For the whole year of 2018, I do not have a single trip memory other than my travels to Bengaluru and Jaipur airports. Oh yeah, after thinking for some time, I recalled that I went on one trip from Bengaluru to Calicut to attend my convocation ceremony. That\u0026rsquo;s all! I will consider accepting trip invitations from my friends in 2019. Up until now, I keep refusing to join them in their trips due to my health issues, my desire to stay in solitude and partially because of my unwillingness to explore anything outside technology. However, it is time I start changing myself.\nIt was a grave mistake that during my four-year stay in Kerala, I did not try to learn Malayalam. I feel that I missed an excellent opportunity to learn a new language. Although I am as bad as other north Indians when it comes to knowing multiple languages (correct me if I am wrong, I do not intend to generalize all north Indians), I think that learning a new language can be very beneficial for some parts of my brain. Now I am in Karnataka, yet another south Indian state and with yet another language. It is an excellent opportunity, and I am not going to repeat my mistake this time. Even if I do not succeed in learning Kannada, it will provide enough challenges to my brain for the short term. Who knows, it might also give me a new skill!\nWelcome 2019, I hope that you will help me in taking a step closer to discovering myself. Give me new experiences, keep me grounded and help me in contributing to the progress of my India. 😊\n"},"name":"2018 - Year in Review","published":"2018-12-31T22:02:08+05:30","summary":"The year 2018 has been quite a roller coaster year for me.

The problem is in the way these courses are handled. There does not seem to be a proper structure of teaching in these courses. Students are expected to learn on their own and come to the lab and give exams. Although most of the time, the corresponding theory course carries marks for a mini project which compensates for the lab course, these lab courses do have some scope for improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"placements--higher-studies\"\u003ePlacements \u0026amp; Higher Studies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe department does not handle placements, but the quality of education and the focus on industry-oriented courses do affect the placements.

I feel that the department is more interested in making researchers than software engineers. Most of the courses are very heavily inclined towards theory. From my batch, I know at least ten people who are planning to go to the USA for higher studies in the next two years. The faculties also encourage students to pursue higher education (and subsequently research).

I was one of the student administrators in this lab, and I consider that this was the best thing that happened to me during my graduation.\nThe Infrastructure A traditional computer science course does not require many types of equipment except a laptop and a fast enough internet connection. Internet speed is not extraordinary in NIT-C, but it was sufficient for me. The network administrators blocked many websites, but if the site is related to coursework, sending a short mail was enough in most cases to get it unblocked.\nThe labs are equipped with modern computer systems, and Ubuntu is installed on almost every department system. The particular emphasis on the use of open-source software is a big plus point for the department.\nCourses The curriculum was last updated in 2010. Since then, six batches have graduated. I think it is an excellent time to consider revising it. The current curriculum is good enough for most traditional CS subjects, but its focus on the present buzzwords of the CS world is very less. I heard that the department changed the curriculum for the batches joining 2017 onwards, but I doubt that there are any significant changes.\nThe academics are taken quite seriously in the department (apparently). The level of question papers in examinations is generally very tough. I always felt the heat, at least. However, teachers are quite friendly and will help you with any of your queries.\nThe situation of lab courses (except OS, Compilers, and DSA lab) in the department is very pathetic. Operating Systems lab and Compiler lab have a well-defined structure, and the feeling of developing your tiny OS or compiler is one of the best feelings ever. Data Structure and Algorithms lab runs in parallel to the corresponding theory course, and that helps students in understanding theory by practice.\nI cannot say the same about any other lab in the department; most of the students end up learning nothing new from these lab courses. The problem is in the way these courses are handled. There does not seem to be a proper structure of teaching in these courses. Students are expected to learn on their own and come to the lab and give exams. Although most of the time, the corresponding theory course carries marks for a mini project which compensates for the lab course, these lab courses do have some scope for improvements.\nPlacements \u0026amp; Higher Studies The department does not handle placements, but the quality of education and the focus on industry-oriented courses do affect the placements. The placement department of NIT-C has been doing an excellent job of maintaining a track record of over 90% placements from computer science every year.\nDepartment, as such, does not focus on placements much. I feel that the department is more interested in making researchers than software engineers. Most of the courses are very heavily inclined towards theory. From my batch, I know at least ten people who are planning to go to the USA for higher studies in the next two years. The faculties also encourage students to pursue higher education (and subsequently research). Perhaps, it is one of the reasons that the state of competitive coding is not very good in the department.\nConclusion Despite continuous lack of good permanent faculties and its location disadvantages, CSED of NIT-C has managed to produce competent engineers year by year. Spending four years in Kerala can be a different experience for outsiders, especially North Indians, but it is an experience worth gaining. If you have a good rank in JEE Mains and do not mind going too far from home, CSED of NIT Calicut is an excellent choice. I hope you will not regret the decision, though I will not say the same about other departments of NIT-C.\nIf you decide to join NIT-C, do read my article about my experience at NIT Calicut.\nThanks to my friends Aashish, Mahaveer and Faris for reading the drafts of this article and providing their suggestions.\nBest wishes. Cheers 😄\n"},"name":"The Good and Bad about CSED of NIT-C","published":"2018-06-14T17:59:28+05:30","summary":"Four years ago, in this very month of June, JEE Mains results were out. I had screwed up my JEE Advanced, so I had to settle for an NIT. My AIR was good enough to get me a seat of Computer Science and Engineering in any of the NITs except the first three (at that time Trichy, Warangal, and Surathkal). I was skeptical about going to NIT Calicut because of its distance from my native place, so NIT Allahabad was the most suitable choice.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/06/the-good-and-bad-about-csed-of-nit-c/"},{"content":{"html":"\u003cp\u003eI am using \u003cem\u003ei3\u003c/em\u003e window manager for the last seven months, and it has been a pleasant and productive experience so far. There were a few hiccups here and there, but that is expected with such minimalistic setups. One thing that I never noticed was the lack of notifications on critical battery levels. For the last few months, my laptop battery was discharging to 0% all the time. Probably this proved to be too fatal for my battery. According to this \u003ca href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5875162/how-often-should-i-charge-my-gadgets-battery-to-prolong-its-lifespan\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e, lithium-ion batteries are not expected to go from 100% to 0% frequently. I recently bought a new battery, and I did not want to reduce the lifespan of this battery too. So I decided to set up battery notifications for my i3 setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href=\"https://agorf.gr/2016/06/29/low-battery-notification-in-i3wm/\"\u003efound\u003c/a\u003e a bash script which shows a notification using \u003cem\u003enotify-send\u003c/em\u003e when battery charge level reaches or drops below a configured threshold. However, I had to do some additional steps to make this script work on my system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first issue was the \u003cem\u003elockfile\u003c/em\u003e program, which was not installed in my system. I installed it using the following command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"\u003esudo apt install procmail\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second issue was more difficult to solve. I planned to set up the script to run every minute using \u003cem\u003ecron\u003c/em\u003e. However, it turns out that cron operates in a very \u003ca href=\"http://askubuntu.com/a/23438/173003\"\u003eminimalistic\u003c/a\u003e environment and notify-send requires the presence of some special variables in the environment.

To provide the values of these variables to the cron environment, I modified the script and sourced a new file \u003ccode\u003e.bat_envs\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

There were a few hiccups here and there, but that is expected with such minimalistic setups. One thing that I never noticed was the lack of notifications on critical battery levels. For the last few months, my laptop battery was discharging to 0% all the time. Probably this proved to be too fatal for my battery. According to this article, lithium-ion batteries are not expected to go from 100% to 0% frequently. I recently bought a new battery, and I did not want to reduce the lifespan of this battery too. So I decided to set up battery notifications for my i3 setup.\nI found a bash script which shows a notification using notify-send when battery charge level reaches or drops below a configured threshold. However, I had to do some additional steps to make this script work on my system.\nThe first issue was the lockfile program, which was not installed in my system. I installed it using the following command.\nsudo apt install procmail The second issue was more difficult to solve. I planned to set up the script to run every minute using cron. However, it turns out that cron operates in a very minimalistic environment and notify-send requires the presence of some special variables in the environment. These variables are DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, XAUTHORITY and DISPLAY. To provide the values of these variables to the cron environment, I modified the script and sourced a new file .bat_envs.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  . /home/yash/.bat_envs THRESHOLD=15 lock_path=\u0026#39;/tmp/battery.lock\u0026#39; lockfile -r 0 $lock_path 2\u0026gt;/dev/null || exit acpi_path=$(find /sys/class/power_supply/ -name \u0026#39;BAT*\u0026#39; | head -1) charge_now=$(cat \u0026#34;$acpi_path/charge_now\u0026#34;) charge_full=$(cat \u0026#34;$acpi_path/charge_full\u0026#34;) charge_status=$(cat \u0026#34;$acpi_path/status\u0026#34;) charge_percent=$(printf \u0026#39;%.0f\u0026#39; $(echo \u0026#34;$charge_now/ $charge_full* 100\u0026#34; | bc -l)) message=\u0026#34;Battery running critically low at $charge_percent%!\u0026#34; if [[ $charge_status == \u0026#39;Discharging\u0026#39; ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; [[ $charge_percent -le $THRE SHOLD ]]; then /usr/bin/notify-send -u critical \u0026#34;Low battery\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$message\u0026#34; current_date_time=\u0026#34;`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`\u0026#34;; echo \u0026#34;[BATTERY LOG] = $charge_percent% on $current_date_time\u0026#34; fi rm -f $lock_path Read this blog post to understand how this script works.\nAs the notify-send requires some special X session environmental variables, we will need a method to provide these variables to notify-send in cron environment. The safest way to get X session related environmental variables is to get them from the environment of a process of the user who is logged on to X. The following script will run every time a user logs in and stores these variables in a file .bat_envs.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  env_path=\u0026#34;$HOME/.bat_envs\u0026#34; rm -f \u0026#34;${env_path}\u0026#34; touch \u0026#34;${env_path}\u0026#34; copy_envs=\u0026#34;XAUTHORITY DISPLAY DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\u0026#34; for env_name in $copy_envs do env | grep \u0026#34;${env_name}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026#34;${env_path}\u0026#34;; echo \u0026#34;export ${env_name}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026#34;${env_path}\u0026#34;; done chmod 600 \u0026#34;${env_path}\u0026#34; To run this script at startup, I added this file to the i3 config file with the following command.\nexec --no-startup-id \u0026#34;path to your script\u0026#34; Then at the end of cron file, I added a new entry for the battery monitoring script.\nTo open cron file:\ncrontab -e Now add the following line to the end of the file and save the file.\n* * * * * bash \u0026#34;path to your script\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026#34;path to your log file\u0026#34; Replace the path to your script (with double quotes) with your script path and the path to your log file with a path where you want to save your log file.\nNow every minute, this script will be executed, and if your battery percent drops below the threshold value, you will be notified with a notification bubble.\nI tested this procedure on Ubuntu 18.04 with i3.

I learned a lot of new life lessons, but there were some decisions that I could have avoided.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/06/mistakes-that-i-made-in-nitc/"},{"content":{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article was originally published on \u003ca href=\"https://www.zeolearn.com/magazine/proxy-your-requests-to-the-backend-server-with-grunt\"\u003ezeolearn\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a build script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive parts of the development process.\nFor JavaScript projects, \u003ccode\u003eGrunt\u003c/code\u003e serves a similar purpose. It is a JavaScript task/build runner that is written on top of NodeJS. Grunt can help you with automatically minifying your JavaScript or CSS files, or reload your browser on every file change. It can show you a comprehensive list of JavaScript errors, compile your \u003ccode\u003eSASS/LESS\u003c/code\u003e files into CSS files automatically, and many other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the most significant advantage of Grunt that I am going to discuss today is its ability to proxy your requests. For example, when you are developing your backend with anything other than JavaScript, you will face difficulty in accessing the backend data in your frontend without having to compile and deploy the code every time you make any changes. It is not possible with a typical web server setup because \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest\"\u003eXHR\u003c/a\u003e requests are not allowed to be cross-domain by browsers due to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\"\u003eCross-origin resource sharing\u003c/a\u003e (CORS) limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the problem here is as follows,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou are developing the UI of your applications using some frontend JavaScript framework (say Angular) with Grunt as the build runner, and the backend of your application is being designed in some backend framework other than JavaScript/NodeJS (say Laravel), you might face problems accessing the backend while running Grunt server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happens because the backend Laravel service runs on port 8000, and the front end development server runs on port 8080. The requests from the frontend server to the backend-server will result in \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\"\u003esame-origin policy\u003c/a\u003e errors due to the port difference. To fix this issue, we can set up CORS through a proxy on Grunt. This proxy will stand in front of your frontend server and the backend server and get the required data from the backend and pass it to your frontend while letting your browser think that you are all in the same domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunt has a module \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy\"\u003egrunt-connect-proxy\u003c/a\u003e that exists to help to solve this issue. It delegates requests that match a given URL to the backend of your choice. So for example, you want to access your backend using the URL \u003ca href=\"http://localhost:8080/api\"\u003ehttp://localhost:8080/api\u003c/a\u003e, you can write a proxy rule so that whenever your user tries to access this URL in a browser, the proxy will get the data from your backend and server it at this particular URL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procedure to set up the proxy is simple. First, you will have to add the proxy configuration to your \u003ccode\u003eGruntfile.js\u003c/code\u003e. In this example, I am assuming that the backend server is running on the port 8000, and the Grunt server is running on the port 8080. This configuration will delegate all requests to \u003ca href=\"http://localhost:8080/api\"\u003ehttp://localhost:8080/api\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://localhost:8000/backend\"\u003ehttp://localhost:8000/backend\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode

Now you will not face any problems getting data from any backend of your choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"This article was originally published on zeolearn.\nIf you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a build script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive parts of the development process. For JavaScript projects, Grunt serves a similar purpose. It is a JavaScript task/build runner that is written on top of NodeJS. Grunt can help you with automatically minifying your JavaScript or CSS files, or reload your browser on every file change. It can show you a comprehensive list of JavaScript errors, compile your SASS/LESS files into CSS files automatically, and many other things.\nHowever, the most significant advantage of Grunt that I am going to discuss today is its ability to proxy your requests. For example, when you are developing your backend with anything other than JavaScript, you will face difficulty in accessing the backend data in your frontend without having to compile and deploy the code every time you make any changes. It is not possible with a typical web server setup because XHR requests are not allowed to be cross-domain by browsers due to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations.\nSo, the problem here is as follows,\n you are developing the UI of your applications using some frontend JavaScript framework (say Angular) with Grunt as the build runner, and the backend of your application is being designed in some backend framework other than JavaScript/NodeJS (say Laravel), you might face problems accessing the backend while running Grunt server.\n It happens because the backend Laravel service runs on port 8000, and the front end development server runs on port 8080. The requests from the frontend server to the backend-server will result in same-origin policy errors due to the port difference. To fix this issue, we can set up CORS through a proxy on Grunt. This proxy will stand in front of your frontend server and the backend server and get the required data from the backend and pass it to your frontend while letting your browser think that you are all in the same domain.\nGrunt has a module grunt-connect-proxy that exists to help to solve this issue. It delegates requests that match a given URL to the backend of your choice. So for example, you want to access your backend using the URL http://localhost:8080/api, you can write a proxy rule so that whenever your user tries to access this URL in a browser, the proxy will get the data from your backend and server it at this particular URL.\nThe procedure to set up the proxy is simple. First, you will have to add the proxy configuration to your Gruntfile.js. In this example, I am assuming that the backend server is running on the port 8000, and the Grunt server is running on the port 8080. This configuration will delegate all requests to http://localhost:8080/api to http://localhost:8000/backend.\nconnect: { server: { options: { port: 8080, base: \u0026#39;public\u0026#39;, hostname: \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, livereload: true, middleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) { middlewares.unshift(require(\u0026#39;grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils\u0026#39;).proxyRequest); return middlewares; } }, proxies: [ { context: \u0026#39;/api\u0026#39;, host: \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, port: 8000, https: false, rewrite: { \u0026#39;^/api\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;/backend\u0026#39; } } ] } }  Now register your Grunt server task to run the proxy on Grunt execution.\ngrunt.registerTask(\u0026#39;server\u0026#39;, function (target) { grunt.task.run([ \u0026#39;configureProxies:server\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;connect:server\u0026#39;, ]); });  Let me explain the above two scripts line by line. In the connect section of your Gruntfile, we add a new section called proxies. The options defined in the proxies section are explained below.\n context: This is the context against which the incoming requests will be matched. Matching requests will be proxied to the backend server. host: The host address where the backend server is running. The incoming requests will be proxied to this host. port: The port where the backend server is running. https: If your backend server is an https endpoint, then set this value to true. rewrite: This option allows rewriting of URL when proxying. What this means is that when trying to proxy http://localhost:8080/api to the backend server, the URL will be rewritten as http://localhost:8000/backend. The object\u0026rsquo;s key serves as the regex used in the replacement operation, and the object\u0026rsquo;s value is the context of your backend server\u0026rsquo;s service.  More options can be found in the documentation of grunt-connect-proxy.\nYou will also need to set up the proxy\u0026rsquo;s middleware in the options section of the connect. The relevant code is as follows.\n... middleware: function (connect, options, middlewares) { middlewares.unshift(require(\u0026#39;grunt-connect-proxy/lib/utils\u0026#39;).proxyRequest); return middlewares; } ...  Finally, include your proxy task in the server task. It is necessary to append the proxy task before the connect task. Also, make sure to specify the connection target in the configureProxies section. In our case, the connect target is server.\nNow you can start your Grunt server via this configured proxy by typing Grunt server in the command line. You should see something like this in the console.\n$ grunt server ... Running \u0026#34;configureProxies:server\u0026#34; (configureProxies) task Rewrite rule created for: [/^\\/api/ -\u0026gt; /backend]. Proxy created for: /api to localhost:8000 Running \u0026#34;connect:server\u0026#34; (connect) task Started connect web server on http://localhost:8080 ... The above output confirms that the proxy is working fine. Some of the example URLs are:\n   Grunt Server Backend Server     http://127.0.0.1:8080/api http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend   http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/x/y http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/x/y    That\u0026rsquo;s all. Now you will not face any problems getting data from any backend of your choice.\n"},"name":"Proxy Your Requests to the Backend Server With Grunt","published":"2018-05-15T17:14:13+05:30","summary":"This article was originally published on zeolearn.\nIf you are working on large projects, it is undoubtedly a good idea to have a build script or some task scripts to help to automate some of the repetitive parts of the development process.

The module performs operations on an Android device with the help of an agent app installed on the device. The agent app, by default, has permission to use the internet connection only.

The whole idea here depends on that particular \u003ccode\u003eandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\u003c/code\u003e permission that our agent app had. It allowed our module to record without \u003cem\u003euser consent\u003c/em\u003e (actually, the user gave her consent unknowingly while installing agent app). Many apps nowadays ask for arbitrarily random permissions. Those permissions might not be related to the functionality of the app in any way, but because there is no method to install apps without granting these permissions, the users grant all permissions to these apps. That can be exploited very easily. This tutorial tried to show one of such exploitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some exercises that you should try if you want to learn more about Drozer module development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA module to initiate a call on a device.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA module to get the clipboard values on a device\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry finding a public exploit on Android forums such as XDA and implement that exploit as a Drozer module.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly tougher one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA module to terminate a call without user intervention (I do not know if it is possible to do this programmatically.

According the Drozer\u0026rsquo;s official documentation:\n Drozer allows you to assume the role of an Android app and interact with other apps. It can do anything that an installed application can do, such as making use of Android\u0026rsquo;s Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and interact with the underlying operating system.\n Drozer modules are written in Python. The module performs operations on an Android device with the help of an agent app installed on the device. The agent app, by default, has permission to use the internet connection only. This permission is required so that the agent can open a ServerSocket on port 31415 (default). The agent will listen for the incoming connections on this port. The console will connect to the agent on this port.\nDrozer modules are inherited Python classes. The parent class is defined in drozer.modules.Module. Drozer console provides commands to create a custom module repository, which is very useful for the local development of modules.\nYou can read more about the structure of a Drozer module here.\nI will explain all the critical parts of a Drozer module with the help of a sample module. I will be implementing a module to record and save the sound from the inbuilt mic of an Android device.\nI initialized a new module repository using the Drozer console using the following command.\ndz\u0026gt; module repository create custom Initialised repository at custom. You will see a new directory custom in your current directory after executing above command. Navigate to this directory and create a new folder with any name. I prefer to name this folder same as my module name. In this folder, create a file __init__.py. Drozer identifies the folder as a module directory if __init__.py is present in the directory. Now you can implement your module in this directory.\nTo begin implementing our module, create a new file record.py in the module directory. Drozer has many different utility classes, which we can use to simplify our implementation. To use these utility classes (mixins), our module class must extend mixins using Python\u0026rsquo;s multiple inheritance feature.\nWe first need to import all the required mixins. The mixins are stored in modules.common package in the Drozer source tree. After importing mixins and extending our class, the code will look like this. You can also import any other standard Python module here.\nfrom drozer.modules import common, Module import os, subprocess, time class Record(Module, common.Shell, common.FileSystem, common.ClassLoader): Now we will set up the metadata for our module. This information will help Drozer to organize and list our module correctly. We can define the name, description, author, date, license, path, permissions, and examples. Most of the available options are self-explanatory. But path and permissions require some explanation.\nThe path variable defined here is an array that contains the values for the namespace of the module. Drozer supports separate namespaces for each module. We can combine similar modules in the same namespace using this feature.\nThe permissions array variable contains all the permissions that this module will require for proper functioning. For example, our module will need permission to record audio on the device to work correctly. So we define this permission in the permissions array. The agent app on the device is required to have this permission. Otherwise, our module will throw an error.\nThe following snippet shows the metadata section of our module.\nname = \u0026#34;Record sound from the inbuilt mic of an Android device.\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Record sound from the inbuilt mic of an Android device. The default save format is 3GPP. Relies on the agent having the RECORD_AUDIO permission.\u0026#34; examples = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; dz\u0026gt; run custom.record.record Setting up recorder configuration...

Saved at location /home/yash/work/drozer/1524201166.3gp \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; author = \u0026#34;Yash Agarwal\u0026#34; date = \u0026#34;2018-04-14\u0026#34; license = \u0026#34;BSD (3 clause)\u0026#34; path = [\u0026#34;custom\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;record\u0026#34;] permissions = [\u0026#34;android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;com.mwr.dz.permissions.GET_CONTEXT\u0026#34;] Now we can start implementing the heart of our module, the execute() function. This function will be invoked by Drozer when the module is run. Every action that the module is expected to perform should be implemented in this method.\nThe implementation of execute() method is slightly tricky and requires an understanding of different classes and methods provided by the Android API. As we are writing a module to record sound, we will look into the documentation of MediaRecorder class. Before reading further, go through the documentation about the use of reflection API in Drozer here.\nThe execute() function is given below.\ndef execute(self, arguments): # unique file names filename = str(int(time.time())) + \u0026#34;.3gp\u0026#34; # current working directory of Drozer console cwd = self.workingDir() # Magic of Reflection API !!! recorder = self.new(\u0026#34;android.media.MediaRecorder\u0026#34;) AudioSource = self.klass(\u0026#34;android.media.MediaRecorder$AudioSource\u0026#34;) OutputFormat = self.klass(\u0026#34;android.media.MediaRecorder$OutputFormat\u0026#34;) AudioEncoder = self.klass(\u0026#34;android.media.MediaRecorder$AudioEncoder\u0026#34;) recorder.setAudioSource(AudioSource.MIC) recorder.setOutputFormat(OutputFormat.THREE_GPP) recorder.setAudioEncoder(AudioEncoder.AMR_NB) recorder.setOutputFile(\u0026#34;%s/recording.3gp\u0026#34; % cwd) recorder.prepare() self.stdout.write(\u0026#34;Recording started\\n\u0026#34;) recorder.start() raw_input(\u0026#34;Press any key to stop recording\\n\u0026#34;) recorder.stop() self.stdout.write(\u0026#34;Recording stopped...\\n\u0026#34;) recorder.reset() recorder.release() # Download file from device to PC length = self.downloadFile(\u0026#34;%s/recording.3gp\u0026#34; % cwd, filename) if length != None: self.stdout.write(\u0026#34;Recording saved\\n\u0026#34;) else: self.stderr.write(\u0026#34;Recording could not be fetched from the device.\\n\u0026#34;) I followed the sample use case given on this page, to instantiate and use the MediaRecorder object.\nAfter the recording is finished, we want to save this recorded media file to our computer. Drozer provides a method, downloadFile exactly for this purpose. This method returns the length of the data downloaded on success and None otherwise. We can use this information to test the success or failure of the fetching of the recording.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all. We have successfully implemented a Drozer module which can record the sound on an Android device without the knowledge of the user. Do you smell something fishy here? The whole idea here depends on that particular android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO permission that our agent app had. It allowed our module to record without user consent (actually, the user gave her consent unknowingly while installing agent app). Many apps nowadays ask for arbitrarily random permissions. Those permissions might not be related to the functionality of the app in any way, but because there is no method to install apps without granting these permissions, the users grant all permissions to these apps. That can be exploited very easily. This tutorial tried to show one of such exploitations.\nHere are some exercises that you should try if you want to learn more about Drozer module development.\n A module to initiate a call on a device. A module to get the clipboard values on a device Try finding a public exploit on Android forums such as XDA and implement that exploit as a Drozer module.  Slightly tougher one.\n A module to terminate a call without user intervention (I do not know if it is possible to do this programmatically. If you implement this successfully, do let me know in the comments section.)  Thanks for reading. Cheers :)\n"},"name":"Writing Drozer Modules","published":"2018-05-13T17:10:13+05:30","summary":"This post is a result of my experimentation with Drozer.

I felt that I was not getting any benefit from volunteering for FOSSMeet. It is one thing that you help conducting an event, but on a personal level, I was not learning much. I wanted to attend talks and learn about free software philosophies, but because I was busy volunteering for workshops in \u003cem\u003eSSL\u003c/em\u003e, I could not participate in any lecture. So I wanted to make sure that in my last FOSSMeet, I do attend all the talks and learn something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut fate had its plans for me. Few days after writing that post, Simsar, the coordinator of FOSSMeet \u0026lsquo;17, came to my room and asked me if I would like to become the next secretary of FOSSCell. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FOSSCell is the group of people in NITC, who are supposed to work on free and open-source contribution. But it is not very active for the last few years. Probably the seniors decided to give me a chance because I was quite active in providing my suggestions for the FOSSCell when I was in the third year and had shown my intentions to reinitiate FOSSCell. Anyway, I was not very enthusiastic about this opportunity and \u003cem\u003erefused\u003c/em\u003e to accept it. I thought that the topic was closed and did not bother about it much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward two months, I was at home thinking about the reasons that I could not get an internship were. I figured out some reasons (a topic reserved for a later post!) and decided that whatever happens, I will not commit these mistakes again. A few days later, Simsar messaged me on WhatsApp, asking whether I am still interested in the post of secretary. This time, I immediately accepted his offer. I was under the influence of my learnings from past mistakes. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I became the unexpected (at least for my batchmates) secretary of FOSSCell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was placed in the first few days of placement season, so I was free on that front. CSEA had conducted a Debian packaging workshop at the very beginning of the semester, but I could not attend that workshop. So I messaged Pirate Praveen sir privately and asked him whether he can guide me about Debian packaging. As with most of the senior open source contributors, he was very enthusiastic about helping me. So that\u0026rsquo;s how I restarted my journey in open source. It was a fun time learning about free software ideology from Pirate Praveen. We decided to conduct a small Debian Packaging hackathon in NITC. As it is a norm in CSE NITC nowadays about any such activity, people did not turn up at all for this hackathon. Only five people showed up for the hackathon. That was disappointing. Though, on a personal level, I was satisfied. I submitted two packages to the Debian unstable repository. We did not have any other activity for the remaining of that semester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, enough of the background!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-observations\"\u003eMy Observations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe opted for the \u003ca href=\"https://talkfunnel.com\"\u003eHasGeek\u0026rsquo;s Funnel\u003c/a\u003e for the proposal acceptance this time also. The funnel works quite well for our workflow. We did not get many \u003ca href=\"https://fossmeet-nitc.talkfunnel.com/2018\"\u003eproposals\u003c/a\u003e in the beginning. I had read somewhere on the web that FOSSMeet had a MiniDebConf once. That seemed like an excellent idea to the team. So I talked with Praveen sir, about the possibility of a separate Debian track during FOSSMeet. I thought that Debian packaging might be a good and easy way to introduce NITC students to Open-source software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn previous editions of FOSSMeets, the organizers used to receive the \u003ca href=\"http://techglider.in/post/2013/04/14/of-fossmeets-at-nit-calicut/\"\u003efeedback\u003c/a\u003e that the student audience is entirely novice for some sessions and the supposedly advanced session turned out to be a beginner session. We were well aware of this problem and thought of a way to solve this. The solution may be a controversial one because even I have mixed feelings about this solution. We decided to look at the GitHub profiles of each participant and then select a few participants rather than allowing each and everyone who is paying money to attend the FOSSMeet. Our experience from last year was awful in this aspect. Students from various colleges of Kerala came to FOSSMeet just to get the certificate. Such an audience was not contributing anything to FOSSMeet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let me explain why I think that this is not the right way to filter good participants. If I am not wrong, one motive behind organizing such \u003cem\u003estudent run conferences\u003c/em\u003e is to inspire beginners and college students to learn about free and open-source software and to allow them to learn about new technologies. Now, it should not matter if the person has any prior experience or not. In our case, we prioritized the \u003cem\u003eprevious experience\u003c/em\u003e part and neglected \u003cem\u003ethe will to learn\u003c/em\u003e. I know that it is tough to identify if a person is really interested in the event or just coming for the certificate, but still, there must be some better way to solve this issue. For now, this method is the best option available, and it worked well enough for our purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to allow only 150 participants was an excellent move. We had decided not to have parallel workshops and talks. This decision was a direct outcome of some of the bad feedback from the previous FOSSMeets. The decisions to check GitHub profiles and to restrict the number of participants made sure that this edition of FOSSMeet has the most appropriate (read qualified) audience for any session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe publicized the event among CSED\u0026rsquo;s first years. We even had a beginner level Git workshop for them. We were expecting that they will come to take part in the event. These events provide excellent opportunities for newcomers to learn about Computer Science and its various fields. I used to give priority to a CSEA event over any cultural event when I was in my first year. But, the turnout of first-year students for FOSSMeet was very less. I sometimes worry, how are these people going to continue organizing FOSSMeet. In the end, conducting this event will become a burden (of carrying a legacy) for them, and they will hold this event just like any other useless event that happens in NITC every weekend. We even made the entry, free for them; still, if they don\u0026rsquo;t feel interested in the event, then they are at an apparent loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne other complaint that we received from the community was that the procedure of selecting proposals from the funnel is not transparent. \u003cem\u003eIn my opinion\u003c/em\u003e, it is true. The organizing team of FOSSMeet sit together and choose the topics based on the relevance of the topics and its relation to FOSS ideologies. Most of the proposals in the funnel were related to some technology or programming language. We aimed to give a chance to the talks which explain more about free software in general. Most of the proposals selected this year revolved around this theme with one or two exceptions. But I think it might be a good idea to publicly tell the factors that are taken into account while selecting proposals. FOSSMeet is an event about free software and the community, and it is the responsibility of the organizers to make sure that they adhere to the ideologies of free software, including transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to select philosophical topics might seem like a great thing. Still, in reality, the student audience is not very interested in listening to some random guy preaching about something which is not very relevant to them. Students want more technical knowledge, which they can get only from technical talks and workshops. I hope that future FOSSMeet organizers will be more careful about maintaining the right balance between technical and not technical discussions and workshops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome students from Amrita college complained about our selection of the same speakers every year. In my opinion, it is a very valid complaint. In my last three FOSSMeets, almost 3-5 speakers are giving talks/workshops every year. I am not saying that it is bad in any way, but the organizing team can start a bit early and invite some other prominent faces of the field from different parts of the country. The issue is that we begin contacting speakers very late and the people coming from far corners of the country or from abroad get very little time for making arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used to have panel discussions in FOSSMeet. For the last two years, we stopped having one. I think that a panel discussion is a great way to learn about different viewpoints of experienced people. It will be good if the future organizers can squeeze one such panel discussion in the FOSSMeet schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow coming to my memories of this edition of the event, I liked the video conference by Bradley M Kuhn, the president of the Software Freedom Conservancy. The way he explained current issues in software freedom was fascinating. I was amazed by his humbleness. I was looking forward to the talk by RMS, but he could not deliver his speech due to some technical issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn a lighter note\u003c/strong\u003e, It feels strange when you are working in a team where everyone except you speaks a language that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I know that it is a very natural behavior, and I have no \u003cem\u003ecomplains\u003c/em\u003e about it. But in my opinion, language is a tool of communication, and when you are not able to communicate your views to others, then there is some problem.

It has been almost one and a half months since the last edition of FOSSMeet is over. I have been a part of FOSSMeet both as a participant and a volunteer. I want to share some of my observations, views, and suggestions through this post. I intend to keep a memory of my most favorite event of NIT Calicut. Juniors can read this post and think about ways to improve FOSSCell and FOSSMeet. I did the same by reading Kartik\u0026rsquo;s post.\nBefore I start, if you have not read my post on the 2017 edition of the FOSSMeet, it is a good time to read that first. This post is going to be a follow up from where I stopped that post. Here is the link to that post.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start by quoting some lines from the last paragraph of that article.\n I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\n These were my views after last year\u0026rsquo;s FOSSMeet. I felt that I was not getting any benefit from volunteering for FOSSMeet. It is one thing that you help conducting an event, but on a personal level, I was not learning much. I wanted to attend talks and learn about free software philosophies, but because I was busy volunteering for workshops in SSL, I could not participate in any lecture. So I wanted to make sure that in my last FOSSMeet, I do attend all the talks and learn something new.\nBut fate had its plans for me. Few days after writing that post, Simsar, the coordinator of FOSSMeet \u0026lsquo;17, came to my room and asked me if I would like to become the next secretary of FOSSCell. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FOSSCell is the group of people in NITC, who are supposed to work on free and open-source contribution. But it is not very active for the last few years. Probably the seniors decided to give me a chance because I was quite active in providing my suggestions for the FOSSCell when I was in the third year and had shown my intentions to reinitiate FOSSCell. Anyway, I was not very enthusiastic about this opportunity and refused to accept it. I thought that the topic was closed and did not bother about it much.\nFast forward two months, I was at home thinking about the reasons that I could not get an internship were. I figured out some reasons (a topic reserved for a later post!) and decided that whatever happens, I will not commit these mistakes again. A few days later, Simsar messaged me on WhatsApp, asking whether I am still interested in the post of secretary. This time, I immediately accepted his offer. I was under the influence of my learnings from past mistakes. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I became the unexpected (at least for my batchmates) secretary of FOSSCell.\nI was placed in the first few days of placement season, so I was free on that front. CSEA had conducted a Debian packaging workshop at the very beginning of the semester, but I could not attend that workshop. So I messaged Pirate Praveen sir privately and asked him whether he can guide me about Debian packaging. As with most of the senior open source contributors, he was very enthusiastic about helping me. So that\u0026rsquo;s how I restarted my journey in open source. It was a fun time learning about free software ideology from Pirate Praveen. We decided to conduct a small Debian Packaging hackathon in NITC. As it is a norm in CSE NITC nowadays about any such activity, people did not turn up at all for this hackathon. Only five people showed up for the hackathon. That was disappointing. Though, on a personal level, I was satisfied. I submitted two packages to the Debian unstable repository. We did not have any other activity for the remaining of that semester.\nOkay, enough of the background!\nMy Observations We opted for the HasGeek\u0026rsquo;s Funnel for the proposal acceptance this time also. The funnel works quite well for our workflow. We did not get many proposals in the beginning. I had read somewhere on the web that FOSSMeet had a MiniDebConf once. That seemed like an excellent idea to the team. So I talked with Praveen sir, about the possibility of a separate Debian track during FOSSMeet. I thought that Debian packaging might be a good and easy way to introduce NITC students to Open-source software.\nIn previous editions of FOSSMeets, the organizers used to receive the feedback that the student audience is entirely novice for some sessions and the supposedly advanced session turned out to be a beginner session. We were well aware of this problem and thought of a way to solve this. The solution may be a controversial one because even I have mixed feelings about this solution. We decided to look at the GitHub profiles of each participant and then select a few participants rather than allowing each and everyone who is paying money to attend the FOSSMeet. Our experience from last year was awful in this aspect. Students from various colleges of Kerala came to FOSSMeet just to get the certificate. Such an audience was not contributing anything to FOSSMeet.\nNow, let me explain why I think that this is not the right way to filter good participants. If I am not wrong, one motive behind organizing such student run conferences is to inspire beginners and college students to learn about free and open-source software and to allow them to learn about new technologies. Now, it should not matter if the person has any prior experience or not. In our case, we prioritized the previous experience part and neglected the will to learn. I know that it is tough to identify if a person is really interested in the event or just coming for the certificate, but still, there must be some better way to solve this issue. For now, this method is the best option available, and it worked well enough for our purpose.\nThe decision to allow only 150 participants was an excellent move. We had decided not to have parallel workshops and talks. This decision was a direct outcome of some of the bad feedback from the previous FOSSMeets. The decisions to check GitHub profiles and to restrict the number of participants made sure that this edition of FOSSMeet has the most appropriate (read qualified) audience for any session.\nWe publicized the event among CSED\u0026rsquo;s first years. We even had a beginner level Git workshop for them. We were expecting that they will come to take part in the event. These events provide excellent opportunities for newcomers to learn about Computer Science and its various fields. I used to give priority to a CSEA event over any cultural event when I was in my first year. But, the turnout of first-year students for FOSSMeet was very less. I sometimes worry, how are these people going to continue organizing FOSSMeet. In the end, conducting this event will become a burden (of carrying a legacy) for them, and they will hold this event just like any other useless event that happens in NITC every weekend. We even made the entry, free for them; still, if they don\u0026rsquo;t feel interested in the event, then they are at an apparent loss.\nOne other complaint that we received from the community was that the procedure of selecting proposals from the funnel is not transparent.

Remember, I mentioned that Hugo would use the \u003cem\u003esingle\u003c/em\u003e template for each page, for which it cannot find a template file. There is still one issue. The \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e page shows the date also.

We can add an if-else statement to detect the type of the content and display date only if it is a post. However, let\u0026rsquo;s use the feature provided by Hugo and create a new template type for the posts. Before we do that, let\u0026rsquo;s learn to use one more template type which is \u003cem\u003epartials\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"partials-1\"\u003ePartials\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Hugo, partials are used to store the shared piece of code which repeats in more than one templates. Partials are kept in \u003ccode\u003ethemes/zeo/layouts/partials\u003c/code\u003e directory. Partials can be used to override the themes presentation.

Best of luck for your endaevour.\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"This article was originally published on zeolearn.\nIntroduction In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a basic Hugo theme. I assume that you are familiar with basic HTML, and how to write content in markdown. I will be explaining the working of Hugo and how it uses Go templating language and how you can use these templates to organize your content. As this post will be focusing mainly on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s working, I will not be covering CSS here.\nWe will be starting with some necessary information about the terminology used in Hugo. Then we will create a Hugo site with a very basic template. Then we will add new templates and posts to our site as we delve further into Hugo. With very slight variations to what you will learn here, you will be able to create different types of real-world websites.\nNow, a short tutorial about the flow of this post. The commands that start with $ are meant to be run in the terminal or command line. The output of the command will follow immediately. Comments will begin with #.\nSome Terminology Configuration File Hugo uses a configuration file to identify common settings for your site. It is located in the root of your site. This file can be written in TOML, YAML or JSON formats. Hugo identifies this file using the extension.\nBy default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent The content files will contain the metadata and text about your posts. A content file can be divided into two sections, the top section being frontmatter and the next section is the markdown that will be converted to HTML by Hugo. The content files reside in /content directory.\nFrontmatter The frontmatter section contains information about your post. It can be written in JSON, TOML or YAML. Hugo identifies the type of frontmatter used with the help of identifying tokens(markers). TOML is surrounded by +++, YAML is by --- and JSON is enclosed in curly braces { and }. The information in the front matter of a content type will be parsed to be used in the template for that specific content type while converting to HTML.\nI prefer to use YAML, so you might need to translate your configurations if you are using JSON or TOML.\nThis is an example of frontmatter written in YAML. ---date:\u0026#34;2018-02-11T11:45:05+05:30\u0026#34;title:\u0026#34;Basic Hugo Theming Tutorial.\u0026#34;description:\u0026#34;A primer about theme development for Hugo, a static site generator written in Golang.\u0026#34;categories:- Hugo- Customizationtags:- Theme---\nYou can read more about different configuration options available for frontmatter here.\nMarkdown The markdown section is where you will write your actual post. The content written here will automatically be converted to HTML by Hugo with the help of a Markdown engine.\nTemplates In Hugo, templates govern the way; your content will be rendered to HTML. Each template provides a consistent layout when rendering the markdown content. The templates reside in the /layouts directory.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list and partial. Each kind of template take some content as input and transform it according to the way defined in the template.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single page. The best example of this is about page.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. It can be all recent posts or all posts belonging to a particular category.\nThe homepage template is a specific type of list template. Hugo assumes that the homepage will serve as a bridge to all the other content on your website.\nPartials Partials are short code snippets that can be injected in any other template type. They are instrumental when you want to repeat some content on every page of your website. The header and footer content are good candidates to be included in separate partials. It is a good practice to use partials liberally in your Hugo site as it adheres to DRY principle.\nOkay, Let\u0026rsquo;s Start So now that you have a basic understanding of Hugo, we will create a new site using Hugo. Hugo provides a command to generate new sites. We will use that command to scaffold our site. It will create a basic skeleton of your site and will give you a basic configuration file. $ hugo new site ~/zeo $ cd ~/zeo $ ls -l total 28 drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 82 Feb 11 11:13 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 content drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 data drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 static drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:13 themes\nNote: I will use YAML format for the config file. Hugo, By default, uses TOML format.\nA small description of this directory structure:\n  archetypes: The archetypes contains predefined frontmatter format for your website\u0026rsquo;s content types. It facilitates consistent metadata format across all the content of your site.\n  content: The content directory contains the markdown files that will be converted to HTML and served to the user.\n  data: From Hugo documentation\n The data folder is where you can store additional data for Hugo to use when generating your site. Data files are not used to generate standalone pages; rather, they are meant to be supplemental to content files. This feature can extend the content in case your front matter fields grow out of control. Or perhaps you want to show a larger dataset in a template (see example below). In both cases, it is a good idea to outsource the data in their files.\n   layouts: The layouts folder stores all the templates files which form the presentation of the content files.\n  static: The static folder will contain all the static assets such as CSS, JS and image files.\n  themes: The themes folder is where we will be storing our theme.\n  We will edit the config.yaml file to edit some basic configuration of the site. $ vim config.yaml baseURL: / title: \u0026#34;My First Blog\u0026#34; defaultContentLanguage: en languages: en: lang: en languageName: English weight: 1 MetaDataFormat: \u0026#34;yaml\u0026#34;\nNow when you run your site, Hugo will show some errors. It is normal because our layouts and themes directories are still empty. $ hugo --verbose INFO 2018/02/11 11:20:59 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml Building sites … INFO 2018/02/11 11:20:59 syncing static files to /home/yash/zeo/public/ WARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 No translation bundle found for default language \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; WARN 2018/02/11 11:20:59 Translation func for language en not found, use default.

This is the directory where Hugo will save all the generated HTML files related to your site. It also stores all static data in this folder.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the public folder. $ ls -l public/ total 16 drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:22 categories -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 400 Feb 11 11:25 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 383 Feb 11 11:25 sitemap.xml drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:22 tags\nHugo generated some XML files, but there are no HTML files. It is because we have not created any content in our content directory yet.\nAt this point, you have a working site with you. All that is left is to add some content and a theme to your site.\nCreate a new theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a lot of themes available on Hugo website. Hugo also ships with a command to create new themes.\nIn this tutorial, we will be creating a theme called zeo. As mentioned earlier, my aim is to show you how to use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s features to fill out your HTML files from the markdown content, I will not be focusing on CSS. So the theme will be ugly but functional.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a basic skeleton of the theme. It will create the directory structure of the theme and place empty files for you to fill in. # run it from the root of your site $ hugo new theme zeo $ ls -l themes/zeo/ total 20 drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 archetypes drwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 layouts -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1081 Feb 11 11:30 LICENSE.md drwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:30 static -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 432 Feb 11 11:30 theme.toml Fill out LICENSE.md and theme.toml file if you plan to distribute your theme to outside world.\nNow we will edit our config.yaml file to use this theme. $ vim config.yaml theme: \u0026#34;zeo\u0026#34;\nNow that we have an empty theme, let\u0026rsquo;s build the site. $ hugo --verbose INFO 2018/02/11 11:34:14 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml Building sites … INFO 2018/02/11 11:34:14 syncing static files to /home/yash/zeo/public/ WARN 2018/02/11 11:34:14 No translation bundle found for default language \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; WARN 2018/02/11 11:34:14 Translation func for language en not found, use default.

It transforms all the content files to HTML using the defined templates, and its copies static files into the site. Static files are not transformed by Hugo. They are copied exactly as they are.\nThe Cycle The usual development cycle when developing themes for Hugo is:\n Delete the /public folder Run the built-in web server and open your site in the browser Make changes to your theme files View your changes in browser Repeat step 3  It is necessary to delete the public directory because Hugo does not try to remove any outdated files from this folder. So the old data might interfere with your workflow.\nIt is also a good idea to track changes in your theme with the help of a version control software. I prefer Git for this. You can use others according to your preference.\nRun your site in the browser Hugo has a built-in web server which helps considerably while developing themes for Hugo. It also has a live reload and watch feature which watches for changes in your files and reloads the web page accordingly.\nRun it with hugo server command.\nNow open http://localhost:1313 in your browser. By default, Hugo will not show anything, because it cannot find any HTML file in the public directory.\nThe command to load web server with --watch option is: $ hugo server --watch --verbose ... ... | EN +------------------+----+ Pages | 4 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 0 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 0 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 11 ms ... ...\nUpdate the Home page template Hugo looks for following directories in theme\u0026rsquo;s /layout folder to search for index.html page.\n index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html  It is always desirable to update the most specific template related to the content type. It is not a hard and fast rule, but a good generalization to follow.\nWe will first make a static page to see if our index.html page is rendered correctly.\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello World!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Build the site and verify the results. You should see Hello World! when you open http://localhost:1313.\nBuilding a functional Home Page Now we will create a home page which will reflect the content of our site every time we build it.\nFor that, we will first create some new posts. We will display these posts as a list on the home page and on their pages, too.\nHugo has a command for generating skeleton of posts, just like it did for sites and themes. $ hugo --verbose new post/first.md INFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml INFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 attempting to create \u0026#34;post/first.md\u0026#34; of \u0026#34;post\u0026#34; of ext \u0026#34;.md\u0026#34; INFO 2018/02/11 11:40:58 curpath: /home/yash/zeo/archetypes/default.md ... ... /home/yash/zeo/content/post/first.md created\nThe new command uses an archetype to generate the frontmatter for new posts. When we created our site, hugo created a default archetype in the /archetype folder. $ cat archetypes/default.md --- title: \u0026#34;{{ replace .Name \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#34; date: {{ .Date }} ---\nIt is a good idea to create a default archetype in the themes folder also so that users can override the theme\u0026rsquo;s archetype with their archetype whenever they want.\nWe will create a new archetype for our posts\u0026rsquo; frontmatter and delete the default archetype/default.md. $ rm -rf archetype/default.md $ vim themes/zeo/archetypes/post.md --- title: \u0026#34;{{ replace .Name \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#34; date: {{ .Date }} Description: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Tags: [] Categories: [] ---\nCreate one more post in content/post directory. $ hugo --verbose new post/second.md INFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 Using config file: /home/yash/zeo/config.yaml INFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 attempting to create \u0026#34;post/second.md\u0026#34; of \u0026#34;post\u0026#34; of ext \u0026#34;.md\u0026#34; INFO 2018/02/11 12:13:56 curpath: /home/yash/zeo/themes/zeo/archetypes/post.md ... ... /home/yash/zeo/content/post/second.md created\nSee the difference. Hugo used the theme\u0026rsquo;s archetype for generating the frontmatter this time.\nBy default, Hugo does not generate posts with an empty content section. So you will need to add some content before you try to build the site.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the content/post/first.md file, after adding content to it. $ cat content/post/first.md --- title: \u0026#34;First\u0026#34; date: 2018-02-11T11:35:58+05:30 draft: true Tags: [\u0026#34;first\u0026#34;] Categories: [\u0026#34;Hugo\u0026#34;] --- Hi there. My first Hugo post\nNow that our posts are ready, we need to create templates to show them in a list on the home page and to show their content on separate pages for each post.\nWe will first edit the template for the home page that we created previously. We will then modify \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to group similar type of content and render them as a list. The home page will show a list of last ten posts that we have created. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add this logic.\nUpdate your home page to show your content Now add your template code to themes/zeo/layouts/index.html. $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html $ cat !$ cat themes/zeo/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\nHugo uses Go Template Engine. This engine scans the templates for commands that are enclosed between {{ and }}. In this template, the commands are range, first, .Data.Pages, .Title and end.\nThe template implies that we are going to get first 10 latest pages from our content folder and render their title as h1 heading.\nrange is an iterator function. Hugo treats every HTML file created as a page, so range will loop through all the pages created. Here we are instructing range to stop after first ten pages.\nThe end command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the next iteration as soon as it encounters the end command. Everything between range and end will be evaluated for each iteration of the loop.\nBuild the website and see the changes. The homepage now shows our two posts. However, you cannot click on the posts and read their content. Let\u0026rsquo;s change that too.\nLinking your posts on Home Page Let\u0026rsquo;s add a link to the post\u0026rsquo;s page from home page. $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\nBuild your site and see the result. The titles are now links, but when you click on them, it takes you to a page which says 404 page not found. That is expected because we have not created any template for the single pages where the content can be rendered. So Hugo could not find any template, and it did not output any HTML file. We will change that in a minute.\nWe want to render the posts, which are in content/post directory. That means that their section is post and their type is also post.\nHugo uses section and type information to identify the template file for each piece of content. It will first look for a template file which matches the section or type of the content. If it could not find it, then it will use _default/single.html file.\nSince we do not have any other content type yet, we will just start by updating the _default/single.html file.\nRemember that Hugo will use this file for every content type for which we have not created a template. However, for now, we will accept that cost as we do not have any other content type with us. We will refactor our templates to accommodate more content types, as we add more content.\nUpdate the template file. $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\nBuild the site and verify the results. You will see that on clicking on first, you get the usual result, but clicking on second still produces the 404 page not found error. It is because Hugo does not generate pages with empty content. Remember I mentioned it earlier.\nNow that we have our home page and posts page ready, we will build a page to list all the posts, not just the recent ten posts. This page will be accessible at http://localhost:1313/post. Currently, this page is blank because there is no template defined for it.\nThis page will show the listings of all the posts, so the type of this page will be a list. We will again use the default _default/list.html as we do not have any other content type with us.\nUpdate the list file.\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/list.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Add \u0026ldquo;Date Published\u0026rdquo; to the posts It is a standard practice to add the date on which the post was published on the blog. The front matter of our posts has a variable named date. We will use that variable to fetch the date. Our posts are using the default single template, so we will edit that file.\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Sun, Feb 11, 2018\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  Adding top-level Pages Okay, so now that we have our homepage, post-list page and post content pages in place, we will add a new about page at the top level of our blog, not at a sublevel like we did for posts.\nHugo uses the directory structure of the content directory to identify the structure of the blog. Let\u0026rsquo;s verify that and create a new about page in the content directory.\n$ vim content/about.md --- title: \u0026#34;about\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;about this blog\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2018-02-11\u0026#34; --- ### about me Hi there, you just reached my blog. Let\u0026rsquo;s generate the site and view the results.\n$ hugo --verbose $ ls -l public/ total 36 drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 about drwxr-xr-x 3 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 categories drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:20 css -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 187 Feb 11 12:43 index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1183 Feb 11 12:43 index.xml drwxr-xr-x 2 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 11:20 js drwxr-xr-x 4 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 post -rw-r--r-- 1 yash hogwarts 1139 Feb 11 12:43 sitemap.xml drwxr-xr-x 3 yash hogwarts 4096 Feb 11 12:43 tags Notice that Hugo created a new directory about. This directory contains only one file index.html. The about page will be rendered from about/index.html.\nIf you look carefully, the about page is listed with the posts on the homepage. It is not desirable, so let\u0026rsquo;s change that first.\n$ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026#34;page\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now build the site and verify the results. The homepage now has two sections, one for posts and other for the pages. Click on the about page. You will see the page for about. Remember, I mentioned that Hugo would use the single template for each page, for which it cannot find a template file. There is still one issue. The about page shows the date also. We do not want to show the date on the about page.\nThere are a couple of ways to fix this. We can add an if-else statement to detect the type of the content and display date only if it is a post. However, let\u0026rsquo;s use the feature provided by Hugo and create a new template type for the posts. Before we do that, let\u0026rsquo;s learn to use one more template type which is partials.\nPartials In Hugo, partials are used to store the shared piece of code which repeats in more than one templates. Partials are kept in themes/zeo/layouts/partials directory. Partials can be used to override the themes presentation. End users can use them to change the default behavior of a theme. It is always a good idea to use partials as much as possible.\nHeader and Footer partials Header and footer of most of the posts and pages will follow a similar pattern. So they form an excellent example to be defined as a partial. $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\nWe can call a partial by including this path in the template {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }}\nUpdate the Homepage template Let\u0026rsquo;s update our homepage template to use these partials. $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;) (eq .Type \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }}\nUpdate the single template $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Sun, Feb 11, 2018\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} Build the website and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value from the markdown file.\nFixing the date shown on About page Remember, we had the issue that the date was showing on the about page also. We discussed one method to solve this issue. Now I will discuss a more hugoic way of solving this issue.\nWe will create a new section template to fix this issue.\n$ mkdir themes/zeo/layouts/post $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} $ vim themes/zeo/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Note that we have changed the default single template and added that logic in post\u0026rsquo;s single template.\nBuild the website and verify the results. The about page does not show the date now, but the posts page still show the date. We can also move the list template\u0026rsquo;s logic to the index.html file of post section template.\nConclusion We have learnt, how Hugo harnesses the powerful yet simple Go template engine to create the static site generator. We also learnt about partials and their excellent utilization by Hugo in the spirit of Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself principle. Now that you know how to make themes in Hugo, go ahead and start creating new beautiful themes.

I assume that you are familiar with basic HTML, and how to write content in markdown.

As this post will be focusing mainly on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s working, I will not be covering CSS here.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2018/03/develop-a-theme-for-hugo/"},{"content":{"html":"\u003cp\u003eI bought a new domain a few days back - \u003cem\u003eyashagarwal.in\u003c/em\u003e.

Whatever I am going to mention in this post is not new. Everything has already been said and written many times on many websites and Linux forums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I will start by explaining the problem. When you try to dual boot your machine to run both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems, you might have noticed that the time is not the same in both the operating systems. It is generally one operating system showing the correct time, and the other one showing the wrong time. It happens because Microsoft Windows thinks that the hardware clock (CMOS clock or BIOS clock) of the machine is using the local time (depends on your current time zone), and hence it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything and shows you the same time. But most GNU/Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Arch Linux, etc.) think that the hardware clock is set to track UTC. Hence the mismatch in the time happens. For example, assume that the current real-time is 10:22:51, and the hardware clock time is set to 10:22:51. Windows will interpret this time as local time and show 10:22:51, but Linux based systems will show 15:52:51 because they will understand this time as UTC. Of course, the above example is true if we assume time zone as India, which is +05:30 from UTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue can be fixed either from Windows or from GNU/Linux OS. I prefer to adjust the behavior of Windows to use UTC. It is much more convenient to use when traveling between different time zones. Please note that this method might not work or cause instability with older versions of Windows OS. I have tried this fix on Windows 10, and it works without any issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen an Administrator Command Prompt by pressing \u003ccode\u003e⊞ + x\u003c/code\u003e, then type \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e.

Stay tuned :)\u003c/p\u003e\n","text":"Arch Linux is a Linux distribution known for its not-so-beginner-friendly command line installer, no ready-to-use system after installation and requirement of above average knowledge of command line. However, Arch Linux allows me to set up a system in my desired state in shortest possible time with least effort. This is why I keep coming back to Arch Linux even after some of its annoyances.\nThis guide is written primarily for my reference, as someone who has installed Arch Linux several times, I still can\u0026rsquo;t remember all the installation steps perfectly. Most of the steps have been taken from Arch wiki and should work on other setups also.\n All the commands are run in root shell unless otherwise specified.  0. Check your network connection If you are behind a captive portal, use links to open browser and login into your network. For WiFi connections, use wifi-menu. LAN connections should not require any setup. The boot environment should automatically detect any wired connections. After connecting, test your connection by pinging any website: ping -c 5 google.com\n1. Setup SSH This step is not mandatory, though I prefer to use this method to install Arch Linux, as it provides me the convenience of copying and pasting the commands directly from Arch wiki.\nBy default the Arch Linux root account password is empty. We need to set up a password for root account, which is needed for an SSH connection. passwd\nNow we need to change the setting to permit root login via SSH in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Check that PermitRootLogin yes is uncommented in this file. If this line is not present there, add this to the end. Now start the sshd.service by issuing the command sudo systemctl start sshd.service\nAlso, note the IP address of the target machine by inspecting the output of the following command. ip addr\nPro tip: One liner to get only the IP address ip -o -4 addr show | awk -F \u0026#39;[ /]+\u0026#39; \u0026#39;/global/ {print $4}\u0026#39;\nNow on your host machine, connect to the target machine via SSH using the following command ssh root@ip-address-of-target\n2. Partition the disks If Windows 8 or above is already installed on your machine, then your hard disk is probably using GPT partitioning scheme. In that case, use gdisk to partition your hard disk. If you use fdisk on a GPT partitioned HDD, there is a possibility of data loss. fdisk understands GPT partitioning scheme also.[1]\nMy preferred setup is to have one root partition and one home partition and use EFI partition created by Windows to install boot-loader. The root and home partition will be formatted using ext4 file-system and the EFI partition should be formatted using FAT32 file-system.\nFor this guide, I am assuming that the EFI partition is sda1, root partition is sda9 and home partition is sda10.\nNow to format the partitions with ext4 file-system: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda9 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda10\n3. Mount the partitions Now mount the root partition (sda9 in this case) to /mnt mount /dev/sda9 /mnt\nIf you have created any other partitions in previous steps, mount them at appropriate locations. mkdir /mnt/home mount /dev/sda10 /mnt/home mkdir /mnt/boot mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\n4. Install the base file-system To install the base system and some development tools, issue the following command. pacstrap /mnt base base-devel\nThis will take a while to download and install. After it finishes, it will give you a bare-bone Arch Linux system with just the tools required to run a Linux distribution, no other software is installed.\n5. Generate /etc/fstab The /etc/fstab file stores the information about file systems of partitions and how to mount the partitions on system boot up. To generate this file, issue the following command: genfstab -U /mnt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /mnt/etc/fstab If you prefer to use partition labels (sda1, sda9 etc.) instead of UUID, then use -L flag in place of -U.\n6. chroot into the system From the Arch wiki:\n Chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and their children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that environmental directory tree. This modified environment is called a chroot jail.\n At this step, we will go to the root of the newly installed system at /mnt and pretend as if we are logged into this system. arch-chroot /mnt\n7. Setup the time zone, locale, and hostname Browse the /use/share/zoneinfo directory to find your location entries. My location is India, so I will use this command. ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime\nTo set the hardware clock: hwclock --systohc\nTo set the locale for your system, open the /etc/locale.gen file and uncomment your language. or run the following command for the default en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8. LANG=C perl -i -pe \u0026#39;s/#(en_US.UTF)/$1/\u0026#39; /etc/locale.gen Now generate the localization with locale-gen\nThen set the LANG variable in /etc/locale.conf accordingly, or run the following command: localectl set-locale LANG=\u0026#34;en_US.UTF-8\u0026#34;\nTo set the hostname for your machine: hostnamectl set-hostname your-host-name\nTo allow other machines to address the host by name, it is necessary to edit the /etc/hosts file to look like this: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost ::1 localhost.localdomain localhost 127.0.1.1 your-host-name.localdomain your-host-name\n8. Create user account Before creating user account, set password for root account passwd\nNow create a local account for your user useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash your-user-name\nThis will set up your user account, create a home directory for your user, set the default shell to bash and add your user to wheel group, which is necessary to gain sudo access in later steps.\nSet password for your user. passwd your-user-name\n9. Enable sudo access This allows you to use root privileges without using the root account. To enable this, first open /etc/sudoers file nano /etc/sudoers\nNow uncomment the following line to enable root privilege for all the users inside wheel group: # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\nNow you can safely disable root account passwd -l root # login into your user account su your-user-name\nFrom this point onwards, it is necessary to append sudo to any command that requires root privileges.\n10. Install bootloader My preferred bootloader of choice is grub. To install grub, we need to install following packages. sudo pacman -S grub efibootmgr\nNow install grub with the following command. sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch\nHere --efi-directory is the folder where the EFI partition is mounted step 3 and --bootloader-id is the label that will appear in your UEFI boot menu entry.\nThis particular step is specific to my machine\u0026rsquo;s hardware, you might not need to run this step. I need to add pci=nommconf to my kernel boot parameters in /etc/default/grub, otherwise tty prints error messages continuously.\nNow run to generate grub configuration file. sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nIf you encounter any errors related to lvm during installation of grub, then follow these steps. # come out of chroot exit mkdir /mnt/hostrun mount --bind /run /mnt/hostrun # back to chroot arch-chroot /mnt mkdir /run/lvm mount --bind /hostrun/lvm /run/lvm\nNow you can install grub without any errors.\n11. Configure the network By default, your current system cannot connect to the network in the current state. I prefer to use NetworkManager for my network management, even when I am not using GNOME. For wireless networking, install the following additional packages. sudo pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog networkmanager network-manager-applet dhclient\nNetworkManager supports basic DHCP configuration. For full support, I have installed dhclient. NetworkManager also supports automatic wired connection detection and comes with curses based tool nmtui to setup wireless connection.\nTo enable NetworkManager to start at system startup sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service\n12. Reboot now If you had performed the lvm troubleshooting steps during grub install, then umount /run/lvm\nNow exit from chroot by typing exit in the shell. Unmount all the mounted partitions with: umount -R /mnt\nFinally, reboot your machine by typing reboot and remove the installation USB drive. If you are not able to boot into your system at this point, boot from the installation media again and attempt to fix the installation.\nIf you can see a terminal with a prompt for your username, congratulations! You have completed the first step towards building your own system.\nI will be writing about making your system usable and stable in the second part of this guide.\nHope you enjoyed the post.

My experiments with the dotfiles (configuration files) also started at the same time. For the uninformed, in Linux, it is common to configure a lot of settings and configurations within dotfiles. Dotfiles are files in a Linux user\u0026rsquo;s home directory that begin with a dot or a full-stop character. This dot indicates to the operating system that these files are used to store the settings of programs like \u003ccode\u003evim\u003c/code\u003e or shells like \u003ccode\u003ebash\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003efish\u003c/code\u003e to name a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, I was keeping a manual backup of my dotfiles by copying them to a folder from time to time. But the list soon started getting huge, that it became complicated for me to keep track of the changes. Then I moved to symlinks. I started symlinking all the dotfiles from my folder to their usual locations. This setup worked perfectly fine, but as my collection of dotfiles grew, It became very cumbersome for me to symlink every dotfile manually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tried a few tools built for this particular purpose. Some of them are \u003ccode\u003evcsh\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003emr\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003estow\u003c/code\u003e. These tools work just fine, but I was not willing to learn new tools just for maintaining my dotfiles. At last, I decided to write my tool to solve this problem.

For the uninformed, in Linux, it is common to configure a lot of settings and configurations within dotfiles. Dotfiles are files in a Linux user\u0026rsquo;s home directory that begin with a dot or a full-stop character. This dot indicates to the operating system that these files are used to store the settings of programs like vim or shells like bash or fish to name a few.\nIn the beginning, I was keeping a manual backup of my dotfiles by copying them to a folder from time to time. But the list soon started getting huge, that it became complicated for me to keep track of the changes. Then I moved to symlinks. I started symlinking all the dotfiles from my folder to their usual locations. This setup worked perfectly fine, but as my collection of dotfiles grew, It became very cumbersome for me to symlink every dotfile manually.\nI also tried a few tools built for this particular purpose. Some of them are vcsh, mr, and stow. These tools work just fine, but I was not willing to learn new tools just for maintaining my dotfiles. At last, I decided to write my tool to solve this problem. This way, there will not be any external dependency, and this tool will also become part of my dotfiles.\nDesign The tool, in itself, is inspired by the UNIX tradition of keeping configuration files for the settings of the programs. This configuration system uses a JSON formatted dotfile.\nHere is the source code for the configuration system. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the file structure of the repository. |-- .backups | |-- 08-01-2018-15:47 | |-- 08-01-2018-19:30 | |-- ...... |-- configure.py |-- current_status |-- dotfiles | |-- dunst | |-- gtk-3.0 | |-- i3 | |-- ...... |-- dotfiles.json |-- LICENSE `-- README.md\nDuring the initial setup, you need to edit the dotfiles.json file to suit your setup. A relevant section of the JSON file is given below. { \u0026#34;pre\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cloning repository\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subcommand\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;clone\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;argument\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/yashhere/dotfiles.git\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;linking\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bashrc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dotfiles/.bashrc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.bashrc\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bash_profile\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dotfiles/.bash_profile\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.bash_profile\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;profile\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dotfiles/.profile\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.profile\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;i3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dotfiles/i3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.config/i3\u0026#34; }, ] }\nAs can be seen, the JSON file has an array variable linking, which can be used to set the paths for each configuration file and folder. The configure.py script also requires a dotfiles folder to be present in the current directory. The folder can be created manually, or if it is already version controlled on GitHub, then the script can clone it. For that, you can edit the pre section in the dotfiles.json.\nYour dotfiles and config folders go inside the dotfiles folder. You need to copy all your current configurations to this folder to get started.\nSo, how does the script know where a file or folder will be linked? Simple, you need to edit the dotfiles.json file and add source and destination locations. For example, if you want to set up configurations of i3 to its original location (which is, $HOME/.config/i3), then you need to create a new JSON object in the linking array, like this. { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;i3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dotfiles/i3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.config/i3\u0026#34; }\nHere the name is used to identify the configuration file, the src parameter is the location of your config file/folder in the dotfiles directory, and the dest parameter is the final destination of the file/folder. Keen observers would notice that I have not used $HOME anywhere. It is understood that the configuration will go to the current user\u0026rsquo;s home directory.

From the support page of ALM Octane:\n ALM Octane is a web-based application lifecycle management platform that enables teams to collaborate easily, manage the product delivery pipeline, and visualize the impact of changes.\n Precursor My department insists on using open-source software (a plus point, indeed!). But ALM Octane has Oracle DB/MSSQL as a dependency. My professor was not very enthusiastic about installing a proprietary database on the server. So I came up with a different approach. I set up this database (free version of Oracle DB, the Oracle Database 11g Express Edition) in a Docker container. ALM Octane has three components \u0026ndash; Oracle DB, Elastic Search, and the Octane Server itself. The problem was to handle the condition that these three components should be installed on different machines. I decided to use three separate Docker containers for this isolation and then configured them to communicate with each other with docker-compose.\nWait \u0026hellip; Docker Compose? (Skip this if already know about Docker and Compose)\n Docker-compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Compose uses a compose file to configure the services used by the applications. Then all the services and the application can be run by using a single command.\n So before reading this article any further, if you do not know about docker-compose, go and read about it.\nThe Problem Three primary services are required for the proper functioning of the Octane Server \u0026ndash; Octane, Oracle DB and Elastic Search. The difficulty was to set up adequate configuration options for these services and the appropriate setup for communication between them. I searched on Docker Hub for any pre-built images. Fortunately, I found some pre-built Docker images for my purpose. So I started writing my config file.\nThe Solution Here is my config file for easy reference. version:\u0026#39;2\u0026#39;services:octane_oracle:image:alexeiled/docker-oracle-xe-11gshm_size:2gmem_limit:4goctane_es:image:elasticsearch:2.4environment:- ES_HEAP_SIZE=4Gmem_limit:4goctane:image:hpsoftware/almoctaneports:- \u0026#34;8080:8080\u0026#34;volumes:- /opt/octane/conf:/opt/octane/conf- /opt/octane/log:/opt/octane/log- /opt/octane/repo:/opt/octane/repolinks:- octane_oracle- octane_esmem_limit:4genv_file:- ./octane.env\nThe configuration options in the code are for a system with RAM of 8GB. The options must be tuned for the best performance before deploying on the production server.\nIn the code, I have exposed port 8080 of the Octane Docker container to the port 8080 of the host machine. It will make sure that we can access the Octane application on localhost:8080. The octane.env file contains three variables for easy site management.\nSERVER_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;your domain name\u0026#34;ADMIN_PASSWORD=\u0026#34;your password\u0026#34;#This disables the minimum memory check to enable to run on smaller machines.DISABLE_VALIDATOR_MEMORY=true Now, if you try to run the container with docker-compose up, you will encounter various validation errors.

Also, the docker-compose can be run in the background by issuing command docker-compose up -d.\n"},"name":"Setting up ALM Octane with Docker Compose","published":"2017-12-26T20:53:35+05:30","summary":"Recently, I got a chance to set up ALM Octane on one of my university servers for a course project.

I somehow understood that I was not qualified enough to guide someone about open source contribution or in general FOSS ideology, because I, myself was not contributing anything to open source community, and had no characteristic of a FOSS enthusiast. So I somehow lost my interest in FOSSCell and even in Linux. Shrimadhav asked me my ideas about FOSSCell activities, but I had no clue what to say. So that\u0026rsquo;s how the FOSSCell again died without achieving anything significant. I feel it was my mistake. I still feel sad about this. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fossmeet-time\"\u003eFOSSMeet time\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo as the FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;s dates came near, people started coming for \u003cem\u003evolunteering\u003c/em\u003e. It was good for the event, though. The funnel was already up last semester, and we were getting some good proposals also. FOSSMeet also went superbly. All the participants gave excellent reviews. There were some hiccups also, The Campus Internet Connectivity being the most significant one. There were some issues in SSL also, again, somewhere I hold an important responsibility. All in all, everybody praised the event and organization of the event. This year, we tried to reduce the use of plastics, and I feel that we were quite successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-observations\"\u003eMy Observations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some issues about the event, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like at a personal level. I sometimes think about what is the motive for conducting some activities in colleges. An event like FOSSMeet which attract the attention of all FOSS enthusiasts from all over Kerala has a huge potential of inspiring the young folks of NIT Calicut. We somehow succeed in that motive, but what about the situation after FOSSMeet. The enthusiasm about FOSS should not last just for two days, but we cannot blame others for the condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a proper idea about the FOSS because there was no proper guidance from my senior batches. I learned many things in the workshops organized by CSEA, in fact, I first learned the proper use of Linux Shell in the Linux workshop conducted by CSEA (and FOSSCell, at least for formality). But you can\u0026rsquo;t ask them to do everything. I think they are already overloaded. But there were no such workshops by FOSSCell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, the curriculum of the NITC CSE department focuses more on the theoretical side of Computer Science, which is good. But it negatively affects student activities outside the classroom. That is one of the primary reasons why we cannot produce more GSoC participants or why don\u0026rsquo;t we have more open source enthusiasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird, one of the speakers in FOSSMeet mentioned one fundamental flaw in the structure of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any representation from other branches. FOSSMeet has become an event for CSE folks, where people from different departments do not take any interest. I think publicity was a major issue here. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there was any publicity done to explain FOSSMeet to the students of other branches. (If I am wrong here, please correct me).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth, people are ready to \u003cem\u003evolunteer\u003c/em\u003e for organizing an event, but they do not want to come and attend the workshops. FOSSMeet is held by individuals who have no previous experience of FOSS and have no intention to dive into open source community any time soon. FOSSMeet has become a tradition that is continued every year because it happened the previous year also. I do not feel that enthusiasm to promote FOSS in FOSSMeet because we are organizing it to keep the legacy. I am not saying that whatever effort organizers put in conducting FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was not significant. I am not the right person to blame them because I was also part of the same team. But still, I feel that FOSSMeet has lost its original motive to promote FOSS culture in NITC. It encourages more people from outside NITC, but inside NITC, it is just one of those many events organized by random clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been an interesting one year for me after becoming SS Lab Admin because I started taking part in department activities that I always wanted to do. Being a member of the organizing team of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was again a learning experience for me. I learned many new things, in SSL and outside SSL too. I committed some mistakes also in making the right decisions at the right moment, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I learn.

So I somehow lost my interest in FOSSCell and even in Linux. Shrimadhav asked me my ideas about FOSSCell activities, but I had no clue what to say. So that\u0026rsquo;s how the FOSSCell again died without achieving anything significant. I feel it was my mistake. I still feel sad about this. :(\nFOSSMeet time So as the FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;s dates came near, people started coming for volunteering. It was good for the event, though. The funnel was already up last semester, and we were getting some good proposals also. FOSSMeet also went superbly. All the participants gave excellent reviews. There were some hiccups also, The Campus Internet Connectivity being the most significant one. There were some issues in SSL also, again, somewhere I hold an important responsibility. All in all, everybody praised the event and organization of the event. This year, we tried to reduce the use of plastics, and I feel that we were quite successful.\nMy Observations There were some issues about the event, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like at a personal level. I sometimes think about what is the motive for conducting some activities in colleges. An event like FOSSMeet which attract the attention of all FOSS enthusiasts from all over Kerala has a huge potential of inspiring the young folks of NIT Calicut. We somehow succeed in that motive, but what about the situation after FOSSMeet. The enthusiasm about FOSS should not last just for two days, but we cannot blame others for the condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a proper idea about the FOSS because there was no proper guidance from my senior batches. I learned many things in the workshops organized by CSEA, in fact, I first learned the proper use of Linux Shell in the Linux workshop conducted by CSEA (and FOSSCell, at least for formality). But you can\u0026rsquo;t ask them to do everything. I think they are already overloaded. But there were no such workshops by FOSSCell.\nSecond, the curriculum of the NITC CSE department focuses more on the theoretical side of Computer Science, which is good. But it negatively affects student activities outside the classroom. That is one of the primary reasons why we cannot produce more GSoC participants or why don\u0026rsquo;t we have more open source enthusiasts.\nThird, one of the speakers in FOSSMeet mentioned one fundamental flaw in the structure of the organizing team of FOSSMeet. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any representation from other branches. FOSSMeet has become an event for CSE folks, where people from different departments do not take any interest. I think publicity was a major issue here. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there was any publicity done to explain FOSSMeet to the students of other branches. (If I am wrong here, please correct me).\nFourth, people are ready to volunteer for organizing an event, but they do not want to come and attend the workshops. FOSSMeet is held by individuals who have no previous experience of FOSS and have no intention to dive into open source community any time soon. FOSSMeet has become a tradition that is continued every year because it happened the previous year also. I do not feel that enthusiasm to promote FOSS in FOSSMeet because we are organizing it to keep the legacy. I am not saying that whatever effort organizers put in conducting FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was not significant. I am not the right person to blame them because I was also part of the same team. But still, I feel that FOSSMeet has lost its original motive to promote FOSS culture in NITC. It encourages more people from outside NITC, but inside NITC, it is just one of those many events organized by random clubs.\nConclusion It\u0026rsquo;s been an interesting one year for me after becoming SS Lab Admin because I started taking part in department activities that I always wanted to do. Being a member of the organizing team of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was again a learning experience for me. I learned many new things, in SSL and outside SSL too. I committed some mistakes also in making the right decisions at the right moment, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I learn. So no regrets. :) I hope that I will find time next year for FOSSMeet, although I would prefer to attend FOSSMeet as a participant observing everything silently rather than being a part of the organizing team.\n"},"name":"FOSSMeet'17","published":"2017-03-13T21:03:16Z","summary":"One more edition of FOSSMeet\u0026rsquo;17 was successfully organized in NIT Calicut recently.

So till now, I have experimented with Wordpress, Jekyll, Pelican, and Hugo. Without any doubt, Hugo is the simplest to set up. This time, I have setup Hugo in Windows, as I think, in my system, I reinstall Windows OS much less frequently than the Linux. So that way, it will be less painful for me to set up the blog again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I will list all the process which I used to set up automatic deployment of Hugo generated site to Github pages using Wercker. In the beginning, I was trying to use Travis-CI, but then I read about Wercker somewhere. I was impressed with the integration of Wercker with Hugo and the availability of many its community-generated “steps” for the build and deploy process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/\"\u003eHugo Docs\u003c/a\u003e already have a fantastic \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/\"\u003edocumentation\u003c/a\u003e for setting up Hugo with Wercker, but it is outdated. Other documentations available on-line is also obsolete. Wercker has changed many functionalities in its platform, which made it difficult for me to set up things correctly. But after hours of trial and error cycle, I was able to build and deploy my static files successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I would like to share the issues I encountered and the tweaks I’ve made. The source codes of this site can be found \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/yash2696/yash2696.github.io\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"project-pages-or-user-pages\"\u003eProject Pages or User Pages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo types of sites are supported on Github Pages, User Site, and Project Site. User Sites will serve the files stored in the master branch of the repository \u003ccode\u003ehttps://github.com/user_name/user_name.github.io\u003c/code\u003e at the address \u003ccode\u003ehttps://user_name.github.io.\u003c/code\u003e For the Project sites, everything under the gh-pages will be served at the address \u003ccode\u003ehttps://repo_name.github.io\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy site is a User site, so I wanted all the static files to be saved in the master branch. As Hugo generates all the static files under \u003ccode\u003epublic\u003c/code\u003e directory, I needed another branch to store my source files. So my made a new branch \u003ccode\u003esource\u003c/code\u003e, which will save all the source files for my blog. Don’t forget to remove the \u003ccode\u003e.git\u003c/code\u003e folder from the theme folder. Otherwise, the build will fail at a later stage. You can try using the git submodule feature to avoid this issue. I created a repository \u003ccode\u003eyash2696.github.io\u003c/code\u003e in Github also.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"\u003egit init                       \u003cspan class=\"c1\"\u003e#initialized git repository in site root\u003c/span\u003e\r\ngit checkout -b \u003cspan class=\"nb\"\u003esource\u003c/span\u003e         \u003cspan class=\"c1\"\u003e#created new branch source\u003c/span\u003e\r\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/yash2696/yash2696.github.io\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \u003cspan class=\"s2\"\u003e\u0026#34;Initial Commit\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\r\ngit push origin source\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I initialized my master branch as a orphan branch.\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"\u003egit checkout --orphan master\r\ngit rm -rf .\r\nrm -f \u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;.gitignore\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\r\n\u003cspan class=\"nb\"\u003eecho\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"s2\"\u003e\u0026#34;#Your repository name\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e \u0026gt; README.md\r\ngit add README.md\r\ngit commit -a -m \u003cspan class=\"s2\"\u003e\u0026#34;Initial Commit\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\r\ngit push origin master\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"automatic-deployment-using-wrecker\"\u003eAutomatic deployment using Wrecker\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is straightforward to build a Hugo site. Invoke \u003ccode\u003ehugo\u003c/code\u003e command under your root directory, Hugo will create a public folder which will contain all your content, static files, etc. Then push this directory to Github, and voila, your site is up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if a single push to \u003ccode\u003esource\u003c/code\u003e branch can trigger all the process for you automatically. Here the magic of continuous integration(CI) comes into the picture. A free Wercker account can be easily created and hooked to the Github account and a new application from a chosen repository. After setting up everything, a push to the development branch will automatically trigger the Wercker. One of the most significant advantages of using Wercker is its extensive collection of user-made and well documented \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo;. In this post, I will use two steps, \u003ccode\u003ebuild hugo\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003edeploy to Github\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css\"\u003e\n    \n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"box fancy-figure caption-position-bottom caption-effect-appear\"  itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure  itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg itemprop=\"thumbnail\" src=\"/images/2017-02-22/wercker-steps.png\" alt=\"Wercker → Registry → steps\"/\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003ca href=\"/images/2017-02-22/wercker-steps.png\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eWercker → Registry → steps\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first task is to create a \u003ccode\u003ewercker.yml\u003c/code\u003e file. It will tell Wercker which all actions, it should perform.

Most of the on-line tutorials follow this process which is outdated. Now Wercker uses a concept called \u0026ldquo;Workflows in Pipelines\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor new interface, even if you add a deploy stage in the \u003ccode\u003ewercker.yml\u003c/code\u003e, you will have to create a new pipeline \u003ccode\u003edeploy\u003c/code\u003e under the Workflows tab.

So till now, I have experimented with Wordpress, Jekyll, Pelican, and Hugo. Without any doubt, Hugo is the simplest to set up. This time, I have setup Hugo in Windows, as I think, in my system, I reinstall Windows OS much less frequently than the Linux. So that way, it will be less painful for me to set up the blog again.\nIn this post, I will list all the process which I used to set up automatic deployment of Hugo generated site to Github pages using Wercker. In the beginning, I was trying to use Travis-CI, but then I read about Wercker somewhere. I was impressed with the integration of Wercker with Hugo and the availability of many its community-generated “steps” for the build and deploy process.\nHugo Docs already have a fantastic documentation for setting up Hugo with Wercker, but it is outdated. Other documentations available on-line is also obsolete. Wercker has changed many functionalities in its platform, which made it difficult for me to set up things correctly. But after hours of trial and error cycle, I was able to build and deploy my static files successfully.\nHere I would like to share the issues I encountered and the tweaks I’ve made. The source codes of this site can be found here.\nProject Pages or User Pages Two types of sites are supported on Github Pages, User Site, and Project Site. User Sites will serve the files stored in the master branch of the repository https://github.com/user_name/user_name.github.io at the address https://user_name.github.io. For the Project sites, everything under the gh-pages will be served at the address https://repo_name.github.io.\nMy site is a User site, so I wanted all the static files to be saved in the master branch. As Hugo generates all the static files under public directory, I needed another branch to store my source files. So my made a new branch source, which will save all the source files for my blog. Don’t forget to remove the .git folder from the theme folder. Otherwise, the build will fail at a later stage. You can try using the git submodule feature to avoid this issue. I created a repository yash2696.github.io in Github also.\ngit init #initialized git repository in site root\rgit checkout -b source #created new branch source\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/yash2696/yash2696.github.io\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \u0026#34;Initial Commit\u0026#34;\rgit push origin source Then I initialized my master branch as a orphan branch. git checkout --orphan master\rgit rm -rf .\rrm -f \u0026#39;.gitignore\u0026#39;\recho \u0026#34;#Your repository name\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md\rgit add README.md\rgit commit -a -m \u0026#34;Initial Commit\u0026#34;\rgit push origin master\nAutomatic deployment using Wrecker It is straightforward to build a Hugo site. Invoke hugo command under your root directory, Hugo will create a public folder which will contain all your content, static files, etc. Then push this directory to Github, and voila, your site is up!\nWhat if a single push to source branch can trigger all the process for you automatically. Here the magic of continuous integration(CI) comes into the picture. A free Wercker account can be easily created and hooked to the Github account and a new application from a chosen repository. After setting up everything, a push to the development branch will automatically trigger the Wercker. One of the most significant advantages of using Wercker is its extensive collection of user-made and well documented \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo;. In this post, I will use two steps, build hugo and deploy to Github.\n   Wercker → Registry → steps\n   The first task is to create a wercker.yml file. It will tell Wercker which all actions, it should perform. Here is my wercker.yml for reference. In this, I have used two pipelines, build and deploy. Please follow the official docs for the more detailed steps. I will list all the problems which I face while setting up things properly.\nBuild Following the official guide, I used this step to trigger Hugo to build HTML pages. I had already removed git repository information from the theme folder, so this step finished successfully. If you haven’t, you may add the following piece of code in your build step. - script:\rname: install git\rcode: |\rapt-get update\rapt-get install git -y\r- script:\rname: initialize git submodules\rcode: |\rgit submodule update --init --recursive\nDeploy There is no concept named \u0026ldquo;Add Deploy Target\u0026rdquo; in Wercker as of now. Most of the on-line tutorials follow this process which is outdated. Now Wercker uses a concept called \u0026ldquo;Workflows in Pipelines\u0026rdquo;.\nFor new interface, even if you add a deploy stage in the wercker.yml, you will have to create a new pipeline deploy under the Workflows tab. After creating the pipeline, the \u0026ldquo;YML Pipeline name\u0026rdquo; must be set to the deploy stage name, which in this case is deploy.\nIn deploy stage, I used this step to deploy the built site to Github. Each pipeline starts from scratch, so for the deploy pipeline, the git package needs to be installed again. One also has to set up the environment variable $GIT_TOKEN to each pipeline, acquired from Github setting.\n   Wercker Pipeline\n   You need to generate a new access token for your deploy stage from Github settings.    Github Access Token\n   After adding the deploy stage, add the token you obtained from the Github to Environmental Variables in deploy pipeline.\n   Wercker Token\n   On the next push to your development branch, Wercker will automatically build the site and deploy it on Github Pages.\n"},"name":"Setting up Hugo automatic deployment to Github with Wercker","published":"2017-02-22T13:37:56+05:30","summary":"Recently, I again migrated my blog from Pelican to Hugo.

In every project\u0026rsquo;s contribution guide, it was asked to set up the virtual environment for the project. What the heck is this virtual environment and how does it work?\nAs a beginner to open source projects, the problem I faced, in the beginning, was how to set up the development environments for the projects I was looking at. I searched the Internet, I found some articles, but they were not complete. So I decided to write this guide, which will be useful for me in future also.\nPython uses pip for package management.\nInstalling pip pip depends on setuptools library, which is in official Ubuntu repositories. To install it for python2 -\nsudo apt-get install python-setuptools Then install pip using - sudo apt-get install python-pip\nand for python3 - sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\nThen install pip using - sudo apt-get install python3-pip\nIt should install pip on your system for both python versions. pip is very easy to use. It will take care of every single package you may require for your project.\nInstalling a package using pip # it will search and install [package]\rpip install [package]\rpip install django If you are using python3, then don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use pip3.\npip can be used to install a specific version of package also. # it will search and install [package] with [version]\rpip install [package]==[version]\rpip install django==1.6.5\nUninstalling a package using pip # it will search and uninstall [package]\rpip uninstall [package]\rpip uninstall django upgrading a package using pip # it will upgrade [package] to latest version\rpip install --upgrade [package]\rpip install --upgrade django Creating list of all packages with pip It is one of most used and most useful feature of pip. It allows you to make a list of all the dependencies of your project. # it will output the file to current directory\rpip freeze \u0026gt; [file_name.txt]\nAll these commands above will install the packages globally. But that\u0026rsquo;s not what is desired. virtualenv comes to our rescue here.\nVirtualenv virtualenv solves a very particular problem; it allows multiple python projects that have different and often conflicting dependencies, to coexist on the same system.\nvirtualenv solves this problem by creating different isolated development environments for your projects. An environment is a folder which contains everything; your project needs to work properly.\nInstalling virtualenv By default, if you install virtualenv using pip, it will use system\u0026rsquo;s default python to create virtual environments. To overcome this problem, we will install virtualenv using ubuntu package manager. sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\nInstalling virtualenvwrapper virtualenvwrapper provides some set of commands which makes working with virtual environments much easier.\nTo install it - sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper\npip, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are the only packages which you will need to install globally. All other per project packages will be installed in respective virtual environments.\nvirtualenvwrapper also places all your virtual environments in one place. It makes working with projects very easy.\nNow open your .bashrc and add these two lines to the end - # All your projects will be saved in python-dev folder\rexport PROJECT_HOME=~/python-dev\r# ~/python-dev/virtualenvs will contains python interpreters for each project.\rexport WORKON_HOME=~/python-dev/virtualenvs\r# source the virtualenvwrapper script\rsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\nYou can change python-dev to any name you wish. Your virtual environments will be created at that location.\nNow restart your terminal to source the .bashrc or use - source .bashrc\nBasic Usage Create a virtual environment - mkvirtualenv myproject\nIt will create myproject folder in the python-dev directory. To activate this project - workon myproject\nAlternatively you can create project using mkproject command. It will create a virtual environment as well as a project directory in the $PROJECT_HOME, which is cd-ed into when you workon myproject.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to deactivate current project when you switch between different projects.\nTo deactivate a project - deactivate\nTo delete a virtual environment - rmvirtualenv myproject\nList all environments - lsvirtualenv\nit will also list all virtual environments - workon\nPlease refer to virtualenvwrapper documentation for full list of virtualenvwrapper commands.\nvirtualenvwrapper also provides the tab-completion feature which is very handy when you have a lot of projects to work with.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.

After a standard arch installation procedure, I started putting together my desktop environment, beginning with ArchLinux and Openbox, and then piecing all pieces together to build a proper desktop environment. Building a desktop this way follows the Unix Methodology; have software that each does one thing well, and when you put them together, you get something amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first installed Arch, I had several choices. I tried \u003ccode\u003exfce\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003egnome\u003c/code\u003e as my desktop environments. While both of them have their pros and cons, I ended up liking none. The sole reason was the dependencies; these two software bring with them. My only intention of installing Arch was to have something, which I control, not like Ubuntu, where you are forced to use the preinstalled software and when you try to uninstall something, you fear of breaking some other program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I end up going the route of building something up from scratch using Openbox as a base. At this point, I have a fast, lightweight desktop that is exceptionally stable and is genuinely my desktop as I have built it from the ground up, choosing every application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css\"\u003e\n    \n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"box fancy-figure caption-position-none\"  itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure  itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg itemprop=\"thumbnail\" src=\"/images/2016-06-09/desktop.jpg\" alt=\"Openbox on ArchLinux\"/\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003ca href=\"/images/2016-06-09/desktop.jpg\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eOpenbox on ArchLinux\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"window-manager\"\u003eWindow Manager\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the installation of Arch, the first thing I did was to install \u003ccode\u003eopenbox\u003c/code\u003e, a tiling window manager.

After a standard arch installation procedure, I started putting together my desktop environment, beginning with ArchLinux and Openbox, and then piecing all pieces together to build a proper desktop environment. Building a desktop this way follows the Unix Methodology; have software that each does one thing well, and when you put them together, you get something amazing.\nWhen I first installed Arch, I had several choices. I tried xfce and gnome as my desktop environments. While both of them have their pros and cons, I ended up liking none. The sole reason was the dependencies; these two software bring with them. My only intention of installing Arch was to have something, which I control, not like Ubuntu, where you are forced to use the preinstalled software and when you try to uninstall something, you fear of breaking some other program.\nSo I end up going the route of building something up from scratch using Openbox as a base. At this point, I have a fast, lightweight desktop that is exceptionally stable and is genuinely my desktop as I have built it from the ground up, choosing every application.\n   Openbox on ArchLinux\n   Window Manager After the installation of Arch, the first thing I did was to install openbox, a tiling window manager. You may also try other window managers like awesome, i3, and fluxbox, etc. but I chose Openbox because it is used everywhere. Thus there is a plethora of information out there about customizing it.\nFor our window manager to show up, it needs to be added either in a login manager or user\u0026rsquo;s ~/.xinitrx file. There is a default version of this file that contain some code which we may want to retain, so rather than making this file from scratch, copy the default version of the file to the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory.\ncp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc Now add the command exec Openbox-session to the end of the file. Remember that the system will ignore the lines following this command. An Openbox session should be able to be started by entering the command startx.\nAn openbox session can be started automatically upon login using shell\u0026rsquo;s startup script. Add following to the shell\u0026rsquo;s startup script, ~/.bash_profile for bash and ~/.zprofile for zsh.\n[[ -z $DISPLAY \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exec startx Configuring Openbox Setting up openbox is quite simple. Four files make the basis of openbox configuration. They are rc.xml, autostart, menu.xml and environment. These files controls everything about the window manager.\n rc.xml: Determine the behavior and settings of overall Openbox session autostart: Contains a list of applications to be launched with the window manager menu.xml: It makes the right-click context menu of the desktop environment: Can be used to export and set relevant environmental variables  For the configuration of Openbox, it is necessary to create a local Openbox profile in the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. A global configuration file can be found in /etc/xdg/openbox, which is well documented, and copying the global configuration to the user\u0026rsquo;s directory will give a good starting point to start customizing.\ncp -R /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config/ These files can be edited by hand, although some graphical tools are also available, use of these may be desired.\nThemes and Appearance obconf and lxappearance-obconf can be used to configure appearance and theme of openbox session. There are quite a few themes available in openbox-themes package. My personal favorite is Numix-themes and Numix-icon-theme-git (AUR).\nTo see changes after editing a configuration file, the Openbox needs to be refreshed. It can be done with the reconfigure command.\nopenbox --reconfigure Menus The type and behavior of Openbox menus, accessible by right-clicking the background, can be changed using ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml file. Openbox provides two kinds of menus, Static, and Dynamic menus (Piped and Generators)\nStatic menus are hardcoded in XML and is stored in the menu.xml file. Whenever you install a new application, you will have to update the XML file to update the menu manually. It is a viable solution if the apps are not installed on a day to day basis.\nPipe menus are the sections of the Openbox menu that Openbox creates on the fly by running a generic script and using its plain text output as menu entries. This scheme can be used in different ways, like adding a mail checker in the menu or adding a weather forecast menu. You can check openbox pipe menu page for more information.\nGenerators are the most convenient type of menus. These can be found in most desktop environments where applications show up in the menu automatically. If applications are being installed regularly, then this will probably be the preferred choice.\nStatic Menus The process of making these menus can be automated by static menu generator like obmenu. It will generate static menus from installed applications by looking into certain directories. Others available tools are menumaker, obmenu and xdg-menu.\nDynamic Menus Dynamic menus give the same kind of functionality most people are used to. So it was my preferred choice. They can be used to generate full, complex menus on the fly. One of the most popular application for generating dynamic menus is obmenu-generator (AUR). Though it is not officially connected to Openbox, it is widely used.\nIn order to have obmenu-generator (AUR) make a menu on demand, the menu.xml file should contain the following code as the only entry.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;openbox_menu\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;menu id=\u0026#34;root-menu\u0026#34; label=\u0026#34;OpenBox 3\u0026#34; execute=\u0026#34;/usr/bin/obmenu-generator\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/menu\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/openbox_menu\u0026gt; Panels and Taskbars You can get any panel like xfce4-panel or the simple and customizable tint2. I chose tint2 because it very closely follows the openbox spirit of having easy customization with plain configuration files. tint2 package also containg a graphical tool tint2conf for customizing panel and you can obviously go right to the tint2 configuration file and edit it there. This also means it is easy to pick up your configuration file and move it to another computer, or restore an old configuration since it is as simple as pasting a text document in the right place. tint2 can also have sections for each individual desktop and has various small widget like programs that can be used with it such as a calendar, gsimplecal, a volume application, volumeicon, a battery indicator, cbatticon, a network indicator like wicd which also have a system tray icon and a mini task tray. To start tint2 with openbox, you need to add tint2 \u0026amp; to the autostart file.\nFile Manager Some file managers deeply integrate into desktop environments, and when installed with Openbox, they end up pulling multiple dependencies, which is certainly not desired. Our aim behind building an Openbox set up was to have minimum dependencies so that we can get a lightweight desktop. However, there are several file managers available that fit into the Openbox very well.

The reason is that pcmanfm treats desktop as a window, so when you switch to desktop, the conky hides behind the desktop window. To get the icons and wallpaper, you can use other standalone tools such as idesk and feh or nitrogen. To start pcmanfm is the desktop mode, add the following to the autostart file.\npcmanfm --desktop \u0026amp; and to stop it for managing desktop\npcmanfm --desktop-off \u0026amp; Many functions present in modern file managers require the installation of a few additional programs. gvfs gives you the ability to mount volumes and have trash control. It is not mandatory to have, but it allows on-demand mounting completely from within the file manager, as opposed to having to drop down to the command line. A disk-volume manager such as udisks2 will also be wanted, and for auto-mounting removable disks, udiskie works well with Openbox. udiskie can be added to Openbox\u0026rsquo;s autostart file like any other application.\nComposition Openbox does not provide native support for composition, although having a compositor may prevent screen flickering and other distortion in applications like oblogout. Some options work great with Openbox. The one which I am using and quite happy with is compton. It can be used with or without any initial configuration, although there are a lot of different configuration options if you decide to customize the setup.

Afterall, nobody likes being insulted. For me, it is just another way to have fun with Linux, and anyway, this is way better than the plain \u0026ldquo;You entered a wrong password\u0026rdquo; error message. So let\u0026rsquo;s learn how to do this.\nEnable insults in sudo You can enable the insults feature in sudo by modifying the sudo configuration file. To open the sudo configuration file, launch a terminal and type the following command.\nsudo visudo It will open /etc/sudoers configuration file in the terminal, in vim text editor if you have configured it as your default editor. In distros like Ubuntu, it will be opened in nano. Now you will have to find the section where the defaults are listed. Most probably you will find it at the top. Now find the line that starts with Defaults and append the word insults to the end of the line (any addition to the line is comma separated). If this line is not present then add the following line to the section\nDefaults insults (Always use visudo as it has a self-check system which will save you from messing up things)\nNow save the file. If you are using vim, then use Ctrl+X to save the file and quit the editor and if you are using nano then use Ctrl+X to leave the editor. At the time of quitting, it will ask you if you want to save the changes. To keep the changes, press Y.\n   Sample sudoers file\n   Once you have saved the file, go to terminal and type the following command to clear the old password from sudo's cache.\nsudo -k That\u0026rsquo;s all. Use any command with sudo.
