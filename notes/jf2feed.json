This book is no different, but it does provide a simple base upon which, more modern understanding of finance can be built.\nMost of the things described in this book are common knowledge, but many of us tend to overlook them.

Below are some of the notes that I prepared while reading the book.\nIf I were to write the advice of this book in one sentence, it would be save the money, control the expenditures, invest your money wisely, guard your money against losing, insure a future income and increase your ability to earn.\nFollowing are my detailed notes for each of these topics -\n Save money -   The basic idea here is to save at least one-tenth of your earnings. Learn to live with less than you earn. Control your desires.  Control the expenditures -   Our necessary expenses will always grow to equal our income unless we protest to the contrary. If you want to control your urge to spend, budgeting is an excellent tool. Budget expenses required for your day to day living, to pay for all your enjoyments, and to gratify your worthwhile desires.  Invest your savings -   The first rule of investment says that always save the principal from loss. Ask those who are experts in handling money for advice to secure your savings from the risky venture. Do not get misled by your romantic desires about making wealth rapidly.  Own your own house (this is controversial) Ensure a future income -   Think about the uncertain future and provide in advance for your old age and the needs of your family.  Increase your ability to earn -   Show more interest in your work, more concentration upon your task, and more persistence in your efforts. The more one knows about his craft; more will be the reward.  Seize the opportunities -   Do not procrastinate. It is necessary to take advantage of opportunities to attract good luck. Action will lead you to success.  Better a little caution than a great regret -   If you desire to help a friend, do so in a way that will not bring your friend\u0026rsquo;s burden upon you. Safe loans are those where possessions are more than what is desired.  Some of the quotes from the book which I liked -\n Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you only take what is worth having. If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy friend\u0026rsquo;s burdens upon thyself. Learning was of two kinds: the one being the things we learned and knew, and the other being the training that taught us how to find out what we did not know? The hungrier one becomes, the clearer one\u0026rsquo;s mind works— also the more sensitive one becomes to the odors of food. As for time, all men have it in abundance. Where the determination is, the way can be found. \u0026lsquo;A part of all I earn is mine to keep.\u0026rsquo; - say it in the morning when you first arise. Say it at noon. Say it at night. Say it each hour of every day. Say it to yourself until the words stand out like letters of fire across the sky. Work, well-done, does good to the man who does it. It makes him a better man. Proper preparation is the key to our success. Our acts can be no wiser than our thoughts. Our thinking can be no wiser than our understanding. Men of action are favored by the goddess of good luck. Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared. Desires must be simple and definite. They defeat their own purpose should they be too many, too confusing, or beyond a man\u0026rsquo;s training to accomplish. One may not condemn a man for succeeding because he knows how. Neither may one with justice take away from a man what he has fairly earned, to give to men of less ability. That what each of us calls our necessary expenses will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary. Better a little caution than a great regret. Our wise acts accompany us through life to please us and to help us. Just as surely, our unwise acts follow us to plague and torment us. Life is hard and there will always be some who cannot adjust themselves to it.

Getting rich is a game of offense, not defense. I believe millionaire is today\u0026rsquo;s new middle class. Do the math to create possibility, then create a strategy. The best ideas are always simple. The creation of wealth is not about saving or investing; it is about creating multiple sources of income. 3/4 millionaires work for somebody else. Lose your middle-class mind and be okay with becoming a millionaire. The more people you help, the more money you will have. Always move your surplus income to some accounts reserved for future investments. Always stay broke, even if you have a lot of money. That way you will never spend more. I watch the pretenders sleep like they are rich while I am up like I am broke. We both deceive ourselves but with very different outcomes. Idea + Hard Work x Long Time + Discipline = Success Stay broke, not poor. Save to Invest, don\u0026rsquo;t save to Save. You should think long and hard before walking away from any income flow. The first sign that you are on your way is when the people close to you start to question why you are working so hard. When you change, you may become a threat to all those who don\u0026rsquo;t. If you are truly committed to becoming a millionaire, you will at some point need to change your environment. One way to find the right people is to continue investing in yourself. Don\u0026rsquo;t spend time and money on things, toys, holidays, or moments, invest in the surest investment of your life \u0026ndash; YOU!

I am entirely new to managing money, so I thought it would be a\ngood idea to gain some knowledge before trying anything crazy. I must say, this book has not disappointed me. I do not\nknow, how other personal-finance books are written, but from my point of view, I learned a lot by reading this\nbook. I have already implemented some of the ideas mentioned in this book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best things that I learned from this book is to automate everything. As a Computer Engineer, it is easily\nrelatable. The author says that if you enable automatic transfers to transfer money from your checking account to\ndifferent accounts, then you will not look at the money, and hence you will not have the urge to spend the money.

The author has done excellent work in making sure that even\nan uninitiated person in Cryptography can understand and appreciate the importance of work done in this field. The people\nunequipped with the necessary background knowledge will enjoy this book as much as the math nerds. The book\ncontains very little mathematical stuff, but the author tries to explain the ciphers by taking appropriate examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoyed the story of the breaking of the Enigma Machine.

Probably one reason behind this was my lack of\nknowledge about Quantum Computing. Although a few days back, two of my colleagues were discussing an idea about Quantum\nComputing.

The Muslim civilization provided an ideal cradle for cryptanalysis, because Islam demands justice in all spheres of human activity, and achieving this requires knowledge, or ilm.

The author has done excellent work in making sure that even an uninitiated person in Cryptography can understand and appreciate the importance of work done in this field. The people unequipped with the necessary background knowledge will enjoy this book as much as the math nerds. The book contains very little mathematical stuff, but the author tries to explain the ciphers by taking appropriate examples.\nI enjoyed the story of the breaking of the Enigma Machine. It seems to be a perfect time to watch The Imitation Game. 😄 The book gets boring in the post RSA part. Probably one reason behind this was my lack of knowledge about Quantum Computing. Although a few days back, two of my colleagues were discussing an idea about Quantum Computing. I overheard their discussion, and surprisingly, I was able to understand everything they were talking, to some extent. So I guess that this book has at least initiated me to the field of Quantum Computing.\nIt was a 5-star book for me, and it has reserved its place in my favorite books shelf. I will revisit this book in future when I get a chance to teach Cryptography to someone. Before that, I need to learn Cryptography, right! Anyone reading this review, if you have any recommendations for books on Cryptography and Number Theory, please do comment.\nHere are some of my favorite quotes from the book (not in any particular order):\n  It has been said that the First World War was the chemists’ war, because mustard gas and chlorine were employed for the first time, and that the Second World War was the physicists’ war, because the atom bomb was detonated. Similarly, it has been argued that the Third World War would be the mathematicians’ war, because mathematicians will have control over the next great weapon of war — information.\n  The only people who are in a position to point out my errors are also those who are not at liberty to reveal them.\n  How to conceal a message within a hard-boiled egg by making an ink from a mixture of one ounce of alum and a pint of vinegar, and then using it to write on the shell. The solution penetrates the porous shell, and leaves a message on the surface of the hardened egg albumen, which can be read only when the shell is removed.\n  The security of a cryptosystem must not depend on keeping secret the crypto-algorithm. The security depends only on keeping secret the key.\n  A man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it from the vulgar.\n  A code is defined as substitution at the level of words or phrases, whereas a cipher is defined as substitution at the level of letters. Hence the term encipher means to scramble a message using a cipher, while encode means to scramble a message using a code. Similarly, the term decipher applies to unscrambling an enciphered message, and decode to unscrambling an encoded message. The terms encrypt and decrypt are more general, and cover scrambling and unscrambling with respect to both codes and ciphers.\n  I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam! - Charles Babbage\n  Nothing should be as favorably regarded as intelligence; nothing should be as generously rewarded as intelligence; nothing should be as confidential as the work of intelligence. - Sun Tzu\n  Adversity is one of the foundations of successful codebreaking.\n  The Polish success in breaking the Enigma cipher can be attributed to three factors: fear, mathematics and espionage.\n  It’s about right and wrong. In general terms. It’s a technical paper in mathematical logic, but it’s also about the difficulty of telling right from wrong. People think—most people think—that in mathematics we always know what is right and what is wrong. Not so. Not any more.\n  The way to get to the top of the heap in terms of developing original research is to be a fool, because only fools keep trying. You have idea number 1, you get excited, and it flops. Then you have idea number 2, you get excited, and it flops. Then you have idea number 99, you get excited, and it flops. Only a fool would be excited by the 100th idea, but it might take 100 ideas before one really pays off. Unless you’re foolish enough to be continually excited, you won’t have the motivation, you won’t have the energy to carry it through. God rewards fools.\n  Mixing yellow and blue paint to make green paint is a one-way function because it is easy to mix the paint, but impossible to unmix it. Another one-way function is the cracking of an egg, because it is easy to crack an egg but impossible then to return the egg to its original condition. For this reason, one-way functions are sometimes called Humpty Dumpty functions.\n  The easiest way to understand the concept of a two-way function is in terms of an everyday activity. The act of turning on a light switch is a function, because it turns an ordinary lightbulb into an illuminated lightbulb. This function is two-way because if a switch is turned on, it is easy enough to turn it off and return the light-bulb to its original state.\n  An existence theorem shows that a particular concept is possible, but is not concerned with the details of the concept.\n  We cannot know, as a matter of principle, the present in all its details.\n  Propose to an Englishman any principle, or any instrument, however admirable, and you will observe that the whole effort of the English mind is directed to find a difficulty, a defect, or an impossibility in it. If you speak to him of a machine for peeling a potato, he will pronounce it impossible: if you peel a potato with it before his eyes, he will declare it useless, because it will not slice a pineapple. - Charles Babbage\n  Cryptanalysis could not be invented until a civilization had reached a sufficiently sophisticated level of scholarship in several disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and linguistics. The Muslim civilization provided an ideal cradle for cryptanalysis, because Islam demands justice in all spheres of human activity, and achieving this requires knowledge, or ilm. Every Muslim is obliged to pursue knowledge in all its forms, and the economic success of the Abbasid caliphate meant that scholars had the time, money, and materials required to fulfil their duty. They endeavoured to acquire knowledge of previous civilizations by obtaining Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Farsi, Syriac, Armenian, Hebrew and Roman texts and translating them into Arabic. In 815, the Caliph of Ma\u0026rsquo;mun established in Baghdad the Bait al-Hikmah (\u0026lsquo;House of Wisdom\u0026rsquo;), a library and centre for translation.\n  Cheers 😄\n"},"name":"The Code Book - Review","published":"2018-12-15T19:04:38+05:30","summary":"I was interested in Cryptography and Number Theory during my undergraduate studies so reading the history of Cryptography in this book was intriguing for me.

This book starts with Mohini and goes on to tell the stories of all the mainstream avatars of Vishnu and what the significance of those avatars was, in their respective time periods.","type":"entry","url":"https://yashagarwal.in/notes/2018-11-24-7-secrets-of-vishnu-review/"},{"content":{"html":"\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/photoswipe.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-sCl5PUOGMLfFYctzDW3MtRib0ctyUvI9Qsmq2wXOeBY=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/default-skin/default-skin.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-BFeI1V+Vh1Rk37wswuOYn5lsTcaU96hGaI7OUVCLjPc=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/photoswipe.min.d780348a887d97b4d6cc664301a2941706e4a02aeb1533524fcce3b7b9b64b4f.css\"\u003e\n\n    \n\n    \n    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__bg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__scroll-wrap\"\u003e\n            \n            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__container\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__item\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \n            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__ui pswp__ui--hidden\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__top-bar\"\u003e\n                    \n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__counter\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--close\" title=\"Close (Esc)\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--share\" title=\"Share\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--fs\" title=\"Toggle fullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--zoom\" title=\"Zoom in/out\"\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n                    \n                    \n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader\"\u003e\n                        \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__icn\"\u003e\n                            \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__cut\"\u003e\n                                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__preloader__donut\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\n                        \u003c/div\u003e\n                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__share-modal pswp__share-modal--hidden pswp__single-tap\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__share-tooltip\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--arrow--left\" title=\"Previous (arrow left)\"\u003e\n                \u003c/button\u003e\n                \u003cbutton class=\"pswp__button pswp__button--arrow--right\" title=\"Next (arrow right)\"\u003e\n                \u003c/button\u003e\n                \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__caption\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv class=\"pswp__caption__center\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css\"\u003e\n    \n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"box fancy-figure caption-position-none\"  itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure  itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg itemprop=\"thumbnail\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1483980422l/785820.jpg\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003ca href=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1483980422l/785820.jpg\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"rating-center\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"Stars\" style=\"--rating: 4;\" aria-label=\"Rating of this book is 4 out of 5.\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a time when I used to despise Physics.
