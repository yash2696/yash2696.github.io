On 3rd April, in 2016, I posted first article on this blog. Since then, this blog and its design have gone through many changes. The latest iteration was just a few days back. I also experimented with a CMS (content management systems) like Wordpress and a variety of SSGs (static site generators) such as Jekyll, Pelican, and Hugo. For the majority of the last 3 years, I have stayed with Hugo, solely because of simplicity and incredibly fast build speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that day, I was randomly searching the web and found a software called \u003cem\u003eWordpress\u003c/em\u003e. Setting up a webpage was a very fascinating idea to me at that time (it still is!). \u003cem\u003eHostinger.in\u003c/em\u003e used to provide a basic hosting service for free. As I was in college, I was eligible to get \u003cem\u003eGithub Education pack\u003c/em\u003e and with that came a free \u003ccode\u003e.me\u003c/code\u003e domain on Namecheap.
