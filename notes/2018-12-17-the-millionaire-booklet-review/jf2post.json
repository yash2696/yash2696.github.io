Getting rich is a game of offense, not defense. I believe millionaire is today\u0026rsquo;s new middle class. Do the math to create possibility, then create a strategy. The best ideas are always simple. The creation of wealth is not about saving or investing; it is about creating multiple sources of income. 3/4 millionaires work for somebody else. Lose your middle-class mind and be okay with becoming a millionaire. The more people you help, the more money you will have. Always move your surplus income to some accounts reserved for future investments. Always stay broke, even if you have a lot of money. That way you will never spend more. I watch the pretenders sleep like they are rich while I am up like I am broke. We both deceive ourselves but with very different outcomes. Idea + Hard Work x Long Time + Discipline = Success Stay broke, not poor. Save to Invest, don\u0026rsquo;t save to Save. You should think long and hard before walking away from any income flow. The first sign that you are on your way is when the people close to you start to question why you are working so hard. When you change, you may become a threat to all those who don\u0026rsquo;t. If you are truly committed to becoming a millionaire, you will at some point need to change your environment. One way to find the right people is to continue investing in yourself. Don\u0026rsquo;t spend time and money on things, toys, holidays, or moments, invest in the surest investment of your life \u0026ndash; YOU!
